## **🏛️ INSTITUTION DATA ISOLATION PLAN**

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture with Row-Level Isolation**

**Core Concept:** Each institution gets completely isolated data within the same database using `institution_id` filtering.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Institution Registration Flow:**
   - New institution submits application
   - System approves/rejects via `edu_matrix_hub_schema`
   - Approved institution receives unique `institution_id`
   - All institution data is isolated under this ID

2. **Data Isolation Method:**
   - **Every table in all 11 schemas** includes `institution_id` field
   - **Row-Level Security (RLS)** filters data by institution
   - **Complete data separation** between institutions

4. **Data Access Control:**
   - Institution A: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_A"`
   - Institution B: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_B"`
   - **Zero data leakage** between institutions

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Complete Data Privacy** between institutions
- ✅ **Scalable** to thousands of institutions
- ✅ **Centralized Management** via edu_matrix_hub_schema
- ✅ **Flexible** for future cross-institution features

**Note:** The `edu_matrix_hub_schema` serves as the central control system for institution management, registration, approval, and data coordination across all other schemas.

Let me first check the current state of the file to see any recent changes, then provide you with my comprehensive plan for the role-based system and institution management. Based on my analysis of your comprehensive system and the updated file, here's my **complete plan** for the role-based system and institution management:

## 🚀 **MY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR EDU MATRIX INTERLINKED**

### **🎯 ROLE-BASED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

4. Gets GENERAL_USER role automatically
5. Can access: Social, Jobs, Freelancing, Courses, News, Community, Messages
6. CANNOT access: EDU Matrix Hub (institutional features)
```

**Phase 2: Institution Discovery & Application**
```typescript
// When user wants educational features
1. User clicks "EDU Matrix Hub" in navbar
2. System shows two options:
   - "Browse & Apply to Institutions"
   - "Create Your Institution"
3. User explores available institutions
4. Finds institution → Clicks "Apply"
5. Selects desired role: STUDENT | TEACHER | PROFESSOR
6. Fills application form with role-specific requirements
7. Submits application → Status: PENDING
```

#### **2. INSTITUTION CREATION FLOW**

**New Institution Registration:**
```typescript
// Institution Creation Process
1. User clicks "Create Your Institution"
