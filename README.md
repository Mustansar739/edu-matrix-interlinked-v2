## **üèõÔ∏è INSTITUTION DATA ISOLATION PLAN**

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture with Row-Level Isolation**

**Core Concept:** Each institution gets completely isolated data within the same database using `institution_id` filtering.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Institution Registration Flow:**
   - New institution submits application
   - System approves/rejects via `edu_matrix_hub_schema`
   - Approved institution receives unique `institution_id`
   - All institution data is isolated under this ID

2. **Data Isolation Method:**
   - **Every table in all 11 schemas** includes `institution_id` field
   - **Row-Level Security (RLS)** filters data by institution
   - **Complete data separation** between institutions

4. **Data Access Control:**
   - Institution A: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_A"`
   - Institution B: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_B"`
   - **Zero data leakage** between institutions

### **Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Data Privacy** between institutions
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** to thousands of institutions
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Management** via edu_matrix_hub_schema
- ‚úÖ **Flexible** for future cross-institution features

**Note:** The `edu_matrix_hub_schema` serves as the central control system for institution management, registration, approval, and data coordination across all other schemas.

- Handles complex role hierarchies
- Enables cross-institutional features
- Plans for platform growth (institution creation)

### **üí° Implementation Readiness**

This document provides:
- **Clear development roadmap** with 7 distinct phases
- **Specific feature requirements** for each user type
- **Realistic success metrics** for measuring progress
- **Comprehensive user journey** from discovery to advanced usage

The flow plan is **implementation-ready** and aligns perfectly with the role-based registration system architecture identified in the documentation analysis. It solves the original issue you identified by ensuring users start as general platform users and then apply for specific educational roles within institutions rather than being forced to choose roles during initial registration.

This is exactly the kind of user flow that would make the EDU Matrix Interlinked platform both accessible to newcomers and powerful for committed educational participants.

5. Can access: Social, Jobs, Freelancing, Courses, News, Community, Messages
6. CANNOT access: EDU Matrix Hub (institutional features)
```

**Phase 2: Institution Discovery & Application**
```typescript
// When user wants educational features
1. User clicks "EDU Matrix Hub" in navbar
2. System shows two options:
   - "Browse & Apply to Institutions"
   - "Create Your Institution"
3. User explores available institutions
4. Finds institution ‚Üí Clicks "Apply"
5. Selects desired role: STUDENT | TEACHER | PROFESSOR
6. Fills application form with role-specific requirements
7. Submits application ‚Üí Status: PENDING
```

#### **2. INSTITUTION CREATION FLOW**

**New Institution Registration:**
