- **Status**: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with all edge cases handled

### 3. **Socket.IO Real-Time Integration** ✅ ⚡
- **Frontend Integration**: Added to all 3 group components
- **Backend Handler**: Created complete `groups.js` Socket.IO handler  
- **Server Registration**: Integrated into main Socket.IO server
- **Event Types**: 11 different real-time events implemented
- **Status**: **REAL-TIME COMPLETE** with comprehensive event handling
