# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Email Service - Get Real Resend API Key

## ❌ Current Problem
Your email service is failing because you're using a **placeholder API key** instead of a real one from Resend.

**Current placeholder key:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY="re_aA9VrVLa_9aKAwB4QGBcArZZ2NS8AWuJf"
```

## ✅ Solution: Get Real API Key

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to: **https://resend.com**
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get API Key
1. Log in to Resend dashboard
2. Go to: **https://resend.com/api-keys**
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Give it a name like: `edu-matrix-interlinked`
5. Copy the generated API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 3: Update Your .env File
Replace the placeholder key in your `.env` file:

```bash
# OLD (placeholder):
RESEND_API_KEY="re_aA9VrVLa_9aKAwB4QGBcArZZ2NS8AWuJf"

# NEW (your real key):
RESEND_API_KEY="re_YOUR_REAL_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Application
```bash
# Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened
The email service has built-in validation to prevent using placeholder/example API keys in production. This is a **security feature** to ensure you don't accidentally deploy with fake credentials.

## ✅ After Getting Real API Key
Once you have a real API key:
- ✅ Email service will initialize successfully
- ✅ OTP emails will be sent to any recipient
- ✅ All email features will work properly
- ✅ No more 403 errors
