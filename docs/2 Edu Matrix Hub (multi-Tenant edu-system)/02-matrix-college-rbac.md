# RBAC Implementation

## Role Hierarchy

### Institution Roles
```typescript
interface InstitutionRoles {
  institutionAdmin: {
    level: 1,
    permissions: [
      "MANAGE_INSTITUTION",
      "MANAGE_USERS",
      "VIEW_ANALYTICS",
      "MANAGE_COURSES",
      "MANAGE_FINANCE",
      "MANAGE_API_KEYS"
    ],
    scope: "INSTITUTION_WIDE"
  },

  departmentHead: {
    level: 2,
    permissions: [
      "MANAGE_DEPARTMENT",
      "MANAGE_TEACHERS",
      "VIEW_DEPARTMENT_ANALYTICS",
      "MANAGE_DEPARTMENT_COURSES"
    ],
    scope: "DEPARTMENT_ONLY"
  },

  teacher: {
    level: 3,
    permissions: [
      "MANAGE_CLASSES",
      "MANAGE_ATTENDANCE",
      "CREATE_CONTENT",
      "GRADE_STUDENTS",
      "UPLOAD_VIDEOS"
    ],
    scope: "ASSIGNED_CLASSES"
  },

  student: {
    level: 4,
    permissions: [
      "VIEW_COURSES",
      "SUBMIT_ASSIGNMENTS",
      "VIEW_GRADES",
      "ATTEND_CLASSES"
    ],
    scope: "ENROLLED_COURSES"
  },

  parent: {
    level: 5,
    permissions: [
      "VIEW_CHILD_PROGRESS",
      "VIEW_ATTENDANCE",
      "VIEW_GRADES",
      "COMMUNICATE_TEACHERS"
    ],
    scope: "LINKED_STUDENTS"
  }
}
```

## Permission System

### Access Control Matrix
```typescript
interface AccessControl {
  resources: {
    courses: {
      create: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN", "DEPARTMENT_HEAD"],
      update: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN", "DEPARTMENT_HEAD", "TEACHER"],
      view: ["ALL_ROLES"],
      delete: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN", "DEPARTMENT_HEAD"]
    },
    content: {
      upload: ["TEACHER", "DEPARTMENT_HEAD"],
      modify: ["CONTENT_OWNER", "DEPARTMENT_HEAD"],
      view: ["ENROLLED_STUDENTS"],
      remove: ["CONTENT_OWNER", "INSTITUTION_ADMIN"]
    },
    analytics: {
      institution: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN"],
      department: ["DEPARTMENT_HEAD"],
      class: ["TEACHER"],
      personal: ["STUDENT", "PARENT"]
    },
    apiKeys: {
      manage: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN"],
      use: ["AUTHORIZED_SERVICES"],
      view: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN"],
      revoke: ["INSTITUTION_ADMIN"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Role Assignment
```typescript
interface RoleManagement {
  assignment: {
    direct: {
      singleRole: "Primary role assignment",
      multipleRoles: "Additional role capabilities"
    },
    inheritance: {
      hierarchical: "Role inheritance chain",
      scoped: "Permission scope limits"
    }
  },

  validation: {
    rules: {
      conflictCheck: "Role conflict prevention",
      scopeValidation: "Access boundary check",
      tenantIsolation: "Institution separation"
    },
    enforcement: {
      runtime: "Real-time validation",
      cached: "Permission caching",
      audit: "Access logging"
    }
  }
}
```

### Permission Enforcement
```typescript
interface PermissionEnforcement {
  middleware: {
    api: {
      authentication: "Token validation",
      authorization: "Permission check",
      tenant: "Institution context"
    },
    ui: {
      components: "Component-level access",
      routes: "Route protection",
      actions: "Action validation"
    }
  },

  caching: {
    strategy: {
      storage: "Redis permission cache",
      invalidation: "Role change triggers",
      refresh: "Periodic updates"
    },
    optimization: {
      lookup: "Fast permission check",
      batch: "Bulk validation",
      preload: "Permission prefetch"
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Audit

### Access Tracking
```typescript
interface AccessTracking {
  logging: {
    events: {
      access: "Resource access attempts",
      modification: "Permission changes",
      violation: "Access denials"
    },
    details: {
      user: "User identifier",
      role: "Active role",
      resource: "Target resource",
      action: "Attempted action",
      result: "Access result"
    }
  },

  analysis: {
    patterns: {
      usage: "Access patterns",
      violations: "Security incidents",
      anomalies: "Unusual activity"
    },
    reporting: {
      realtime: "Live monitoring",
      periodic: "Regular reports",
      alerts: "Security notifications"
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setup Process
1. Role hierarchy definition
2. Permission mapping
3. Access control implementation
4. Cache configuration
5. Audit setup

### Security Measures
1. Permission validation
2. Tenant isolation
3. Access logging
4. Violation detection
5. Regular audits

### Performance Optimization
1. Permission caching
2. Bulk validation
3. Efficient checks
4. Quick lookups
5. Optimized storage

## Success Metrics

### Security Targets
- Zero unauthorized access
- Complete audit trail
- Role isolation maintained
- Permission accuracy 100%
- Real-time enforcement

### Performance Goals
- Permission check < 10ms
- Cache hit rate > 95%
- Zero role conflicts
- Audit logging < 1ms
- Instant revocation
