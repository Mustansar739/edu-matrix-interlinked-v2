## Error Monitoring Architecture

### A. Error Collection System
```typescript
interface ErrorCollection {
  capture: {
    client: {
      javascript: "Browser errors",
      react: "Component errors",
      network: "API failures"
    },
    server: {
      runtime: "Application errors",
      system: "Infrastructure errors",
      database: "Query failures"
    },
    infrastructure: {
      kubernetes: "Pod/Node issues",
      network: "Network failures",
      resources: "Resource exhaustion"
    }
  },

  context: {
    user: {
      id: "User identifier",
      institution: "Institution context",
      role: "User role"
    },
    system: {
      environment: "Production/Staging",
      version: "Application version",
      component: "System component"
    },
    request: {
      path: "API endpoint",
      method: "HTTP method",
      payload: "Request data"
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Real-time Processing
```typescript
interface ErrorProcessing {
  analysis: {
    severity: {
      critical: "System outage",
      high: "Service degradation",
      medium: "Feature issues",
      low: "Minor problems"
    },
    aggregation: {
      grouping: "Error fingerprinting",
      frequency: "Occurrence count",
      impact: "User impact assessment"
    }
  },

  alerts: {
    routing: {
      oncall: "On-call engineer",
      team: "Responsible team",
      stakeholders: "Key stakeholders"
    },
    channels: {
      slack: "Instant messaging",
      email: "Detailed reports",
      sms: "Critical alerts"
    }
  }
}
```

## Analytics Architecture

### A. User Analytics
```typescript
interface UserAnalytics {
  tracking: {
    behavior: {
      navigation: "Page flows",
      interactions: "Feature usage",
      engagement: "Time spent"
    },
    performance: {
      loading: "Page load times",
      interactions: "UI responsiveness",
      errors: "User-facing issues"
    },
    conversion: {
      onboarding: "Registration flow",
      feature: "Feature adoption",
      retention: "User retention"
    }
  },

  segmentation: {
    institutional: {
      type: "Institution category",
      size: "User count",
      activity: "Usage patterns"
    },
    user: {
      role: "User roles",
      location: "Geographic",
      device: "Platform usage"
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Performance Analytics
```typescript
interface PerformanceAnalytics {
  metrics: {
    application: {
      response: "API latency",
      throughput: "Request rate",
      errors: "Error rate"
    },
    infrastructure: {
      cpu: "CPU utilization",
      memory: "Memory usage",
      network: "Network I/O"
    },
    database: {
      queries: "Query performance",
      connections: "Connection pool",
      replication: "Sync latency"
    }
  },

  visualization: {
    dashboards: {
      realtime: "Live metrics",
      trends: "Historical patterns",
      alerts: "Active issues"
    },
    reports: {
      daily: "Daily summaries",
      weekly: "Trend analysis",
      monthly: "Performance review"
    }
  }
}
```

### C. Business Analytics
```typescript
interface BusinessAnalytics {
  metrics: {
    growth: {
      institutions: "New institutions",
      users: "User growth",
      engagement: "Activity levels"
    },
    usage: {
      features: "Feature adoption",
      capacity: "Resource usage",
      performance: "System health"
    }
  },

  reporting: {
    automated: {
      daily: "Operations report",
      weekly: "Growth metrics",
      monthly: "Executive summary"
    },
    custom: {
      adhoc: "Custom queries",
      exports: "Data exports",
      insights: "ML-based insights"
    }
  }
}
```
