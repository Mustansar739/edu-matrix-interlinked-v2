## 1. Institution Registration & Provisioning

### Automated Institution Creation and Management System
// This interface handles automated creation and setup of new educational institutions
// Manages the complete lifecycle from registration to activation
//
// When a new user applies for a new institution and it gets approved by the supreme admin, then this user automatically gets a new institution just by providing their institution name and details.
// Ensures proper isolation and resource allocation per institution

typescript

// when new user apply for a new insitution we give if it's approved by the suppreme admin then automatically this user have a new institution just put their institution name and details 



// Ensures proper isolation and resource allocation per institution


```typescript

## 3. Automated Member Management

### User Onboarding
```typescript
interface MemberManagement {
  teacherOnboarding: {
    application: {
      submission: "Self-service registration",
      verification: "Document upload",
      approval: "Institution admin review"

        resources: "Learning materials"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Pre-Built Feature Access

### Feature Provisioning
```typescript
interface FeatureProvisioning {
  infrastructure: {
    model: "Build once, use many",

    scaling: "Automatic resource allocation",
    isolation: "Logical multi-tenancy"

## 5. JWT Implementation

### Token Structure
// Secure token-based authentication system
// Role and permission-based access control
// Automatic token refresh and security measures
```typescript
interface JWTImplementation {
  payload: {
    userId: string,
    institutionId?: string,
    roles: string[],
    permissions: string[],

    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Dashboard Access Control

### Route Protection
// Secure route access based on user roles
// Middleware for authentication and authorization
// Automatic redirection and access control
```typescript
interface RouteProtection {

## 7. Institution Lifecycle Management

### Registration Flow
```typescript
interface InstitutionFlow {
  registration: {
    steps: [
      {
        name: "Initial Application",
        handler: "SUPREME_ADMIN",
        Owner: "SUPREME_ADMIN",
        actions: ["REVIEW", "APPROVE", "REJECT"]
      },
      {
        name: "Document Verification",
        handler: "SUPREME_ADMIN",
        actions: ["VERIFY", "REQUEST_MORE", "REJECT"]
      },
      {
        name: "Technical Setup",
        handler: "SYSTEM",
        actions: ["CREATE_TENANT_AUTOMATICALLY", "AUTOMATICALLY", "CONFIGURE_ACCESS"]
      },
      {
        name: "Admin Activation",
        handler: "INSTITUTION_ADMIN",
        actions: ["COMPLETE_PROFILE", "SETUP_INSTITUTION_AUTOMATICALLY"]
      }
    ],
    validation: {
      documents: "Required verification",
      domain: "Institution domain check",
      credentials: "Admin verification"
    }
  },
 
  activation: {
    setup: {
      database: "Create tenant schema automatically BASE ON ID",
      storage: "Initialize storage AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON ID",
      access: "Configure RBAC automatically",
      monitoring: "Setup tracking automatically"
    },
    configuration: {
      branding: "Institution customization",
      roles: "Role configuration AUMATICALLY",
      policies: "Access policies",
      integrations: "Service  AUTOMATICALLY connections",
      compliance: "Ensure regulatory compliance"
    }
  }
}
```

## 8. Data Access Control

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
// Multi-tenant data separation and security
// Row-level security implementation
// Resource quota management per institution
```typescript
interface DataIsolation {
  database: {
    schema: {
      prefix: "inst_{id}",
      isolation: "Row-level security",
      enforcement: "Middleware check"
    },
    access: {
      queries: "Tenant-specific",
      transactions: "Isolated scope",
      backup: "Separate backups"
    }
  },

  storage: {
    structure: "/institutions/{id}/*",
    permissions: "IAM policies",
    quotas: "Storage limits"
  }
}
```

   - Scope validation
   - Access control

3. Data Isolation
   - Schema separation
   - Query filtering
   - Cache isolation
   - Storage partitioning

### Monitoring Requirements
1. Access Tracking
   - Login attempts
   - Permission checks
   - Data access logs
   - Error tracking

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Response times
   - Token validation
   - Cache performance
   - Query execution

3. Security Alerts
   - Unauthorized access
   - Suspicious patterns
   - Token misuse
   - Data breaches

## 10. Success Metrics

### Security Goals
- Zero unauthorized access
- Complete audit trail
- Proper data isolation
- Token security
- Access control

### Performance Targets
- Auth check < 100ms
- Token validation < 100ms
- Route resolution < 200ms
- Data access < 500ms
- Cache hit rate > 95%

### Updated Success Metrics

#### Provisioning Targets
- Institution activation < 2 minute
- Feature availability: Immediate
- User onboarding < 5 minutes
- Resource allocation: Automatic
- Zero manual configuration
