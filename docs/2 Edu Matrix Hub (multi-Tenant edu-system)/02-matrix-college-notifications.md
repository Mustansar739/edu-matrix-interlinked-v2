# Notification System Architecture

## Core Components

### Notification Engine
```typescript
interface NotificationEngine {
  processing: {
    realTime: {
      attendance: "Instant attendance updates",
      exams: "Exam status changes",
      grades: "Result publishing",
      emergencies: "Urgent alerts"
    },
    scheduled: {
      reports: "Daily/weekly summaries",
      reminders: "Due date alerts",
      analytics: "Performance updates",
      maintenance: "System updates"
    }
  },

  channels: {
    push: {
      mobile: "Mobile push notifications",
      web: "Browser notifications",
      desktop: "Desktop alerts"
    },
    messaging: {
      email: "Email notifications",
      sms: "Text messages",
      inApp: "In-app notifications"
    }
  }
}
```

### Event Processing
```typescript
interface EventProcessing {
  triggers: {
    academic: {
      attendance: {
        marked: "Teacher marks attendance",
        missing: "Absent notification",
        pattern: "Attendance trends"
      },
      exams: {
        scheduled: "New exam created",
        starting: "Exam about to begin",
        completed: "Results available"
      },
      grades: {
        published: "New grades posted",
        updated: "Grade changes",
        trends: "Performance alerts"
      }
    },
    administrative: {
      approvals: {
        pending: "Action required",
        completed: "Request processed",
        rejected: "Request denied"
      },
      system: {
        maintenance: "System updates",
        outages: "Service disruptions",
        recovery: "System restoration"
      }
    }
  },

  routing: {
    recipients: {
      individual: "Single user",
      role: "Role-based group",
      department: "Department members",
      institution: "All institution users"
    },
    rules: {
      priority: "Message importance",
      timing: "Delivery schedule",
      batching: "Group processing"
    }
  }
}
```

## Delivery Infrastructure

### Message Queue System
```typescript
interface MessageQueue {
  kafka: {
    topics: {
      realtime: "Instant delivery",
      scheduled: "Timed delivery",
      batched: "Grouped messages"
    },
    partitioning: {
      strategy: "By institution_id",
      scaling: "Dynamic partitions",
      replication: "Multi-region"
    }
  },
  
  processing: {
    priority: {
      emergency: "Immediate delivery",
      high: "Within 1 minute",
      normal: "Within 5 minutes",
      low: "Batch processing"
    },
    retry: {
      strategy: "Exponential backoff",
      maxAttempts: "3 retries",
      deadLetter: "Failed message queue"
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Integration
```typescript
interface WebSocketSystem {
  connections: {
    management: {
      setup: "Connection establishment",
      heartbeat: "Connection health",
      cleanup: "Resource release"
    },
    scaling: {
      clustering: "Socket clustering",
      sharding: "Connection sharding",
      balancing: "Load distribution"
    }
  },

  channels: {
    institution: {
      announcements: "Institution-wide messages",
      alerts: "Emergency notifications",
      updates: "System notifications"
    },
    classroom: {
      attendance: "Attendance updates",
      assignments: "Assignment notifications",
      discussions: "Class messages"
    }
  }
}
```

## Notification Templates

### Template Management
```typescript
interface TemplateSystem {
  structure: {
    components: {
      header: "Branding elements",
      content: "Dynamic content",
      footer: "Contact/Links"
    },
    localization: {
      languages: "Multi-language support",
      timezone: "Local time display",
      formatting: "Regional formats"
    }
  },

  personalization: {
    dynamic: {
      user: "User-specific data",
      context: "Event context",
      action: "Required actions"
    },
    branding: {
      institution: "Institution theme",
      department: "Department specific",
      role: "Role-based styling"
    }
  }
}
```

## User Preferences

### Preference Management
```typescript
interface PreferenceSystem {
  settings: {
    channels: {
      email: "Email preferences",
      push: "Push notification settings",
      sms: "SMS preferences",
      inApp: "In-app alerts"
    },
    frequency: {
      realTime: "Instant updates",
      digest: "Daily summaries",
      weekly: "Weekly reports"
    }
  },

  controls: {
    mute: {
      temporary: "Do not disturb",
      selective: "Channel specific",
      complete: "All notifications"
    },
    filters: {
      priority: "Important only",
      category: "Specific types",
      time: "Time-based rules"
    }
  }
}
```

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
```typescript
interface NotificationAnalytics {
  delivery: {
    success: "Delivery rate",
    latency: "Delivery time",
    errors: "Failed deliveries",
    engagement: "Open/click rates"
  },
  
  system: {
    throughput: "Messages/second",
    backlog: "Queue length",
    processing: "Processing time",
    resources: "System utilization"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines
