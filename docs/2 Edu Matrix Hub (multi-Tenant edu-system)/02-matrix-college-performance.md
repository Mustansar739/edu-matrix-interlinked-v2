# Performance & Monitoring Architecture

## Monitoring System

### Metrics Collection
```typescript
interface MetricsFramework {
  infrastructure: {
    system: {
      cpu: "Utilization per service",
      memory: "Usage patterns",
      disk: "IO operations",
      network: "Bandwidth usage"
    },
    application: {
      requests: "Rate and latency",
      errors: "Error rates",
      saturation: "Resource limits",
      availability: "Uptime tracking"
    }
  },

  business: {
    usage: {
      users: "Active users",
      tenants: "Active institutions",
      features: "Feature usage",
      resources: "Resource consumption"
    },
    performance: {
      response: "Response times",
      throughput: "Transaction rates",
      success: "Success rates",
      quality: "Service quality"
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-Time Analytics

### Performance Analytics
```typescript
interface PerformanceAnalytics {
  realtime: {
    metrics: {
      response: "Request latency",
      throughput: "Requests per second",
      errors: "Error frequency",
      availability: "Service health"
    },
    visualization: {
      dashboards: "Real-time views",
      alerts: "Threshold notifications",
      trends: "Pattern analysis"
    }
  },

  historical: {
    analysis: {
      patterns: "Usage patterns",
      bottlenecks: "Performance issues",
      capacity: "Resource planning"
    },
    reporting: {
      daily: "Daily summaries",
      weekly: "Trend analysis",
      monthly: "Capacity planning"
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource Monitoring
```typescript
interface ResourceMonitoring {
  compute: {
    kubernetes: {
      pods: "Container metrics",
      nodes: "Host metrics",
      services: "Service health"
    },
    scaling: {
      triggers: "Scaling events",
      capacity: "Resource limits",
      efficiency: "Resource usage"
    }
  },

  storage: {
    database: {
      connections: "Pool status",
      queries: "Query performance",
      replication: "Sync status"
    },
    cache: {
      hit: "Cache efficiency",
      eviction: "Memory pressure",
      distribution: "Data spread"
    }
  }
}
```

### User Experience Monitoring
```typescript
interface UXMonitoring {
  frontend: {
    loading: {
      initial: "First load time",
      subsequent: "Navigation time",
      resources: "Asset loading"
    },
    interaction: {
      response: "UI responsiveness",
      errors: "Client errors",
      offline: "Offline usage"
    }
  },

  api: {
    endpoints: {
      latency: "Response time",
      errors: "Error rates",
      availability: "Uptime"
    },
    realtime: {
      websocket: "Connection health",
      events: "Message delivery",
      sync: "State sync"
    }
  }
}
```
