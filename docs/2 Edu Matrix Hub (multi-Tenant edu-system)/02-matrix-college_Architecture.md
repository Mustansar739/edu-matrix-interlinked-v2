# Edu Matrix Hub System Architecture

## 1. Institution Lifecycle Management

### Institution Registration & Onboarding
```typescript
interface InstitutionLifecycle {
  registration: {
    initialRequest: {
      basicInfo: "Institution details",
      verification: "Document validation",
      compliance: "Regulatory checks"
    },
    approval: {
      review: "Admin verification",
      setup: "Resource provisioning",
      activation: "Feature enablement"
    }
  },

  onboarding: {
    setup: {
      tenant: "Database initialization",
      storage: "Resource allocation",
      integration: "Service connections"
    },
    configuration: {
      branding: "Institution customization",
      users: "Initial user setup",
      features: "Module activation"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Role-Based Access & Workflow System

### Access Control Framework
```typescript
interface RBACSystem {
  roles: {
    institutionOwner: {
      level: "Institution Management",
      scope: "Full Institution Access",
      features: "Complete Control"
    },
    departmentHead: {
      level: "Department Management",
      scope: "Department Resources",
      features: "Department Control"
    },
    teacher: {
      level: "Class Management",
      scope: "Assigned Classes",
      features: "Teaching Tools"
    },
    student: {
      level: "Learning Access",
      scope: "Enrolled Courses",
      features: "Learning Resources"
    }
  },

  workflows: {
    academic: {
      attendance: "Daily tracking",
      assessment: "Grading system",
      reporting: "Progress tracking"
    },
    administrative: {
      enrollment: "Student management",
      staffing: "Teacher management",
      resources: "Asset allocation"
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Data Protection & Compliance

### Security Implementation
```typescript
interface SecurityFramework {
  dataProtection: {
    storage: {
      encryption: "End-to-end encryption",
      isolation: "Tenant separation",
      backup: "Automated backup"
    },
    access: {
      authentication: "Multi-factor auth",
      authorization: "Role-based control",
      audit: "Access logging"
    }
  },

  compliance: {
    frameworks: {
      gdpr: "Data protection",
      ccpa: "Privacy rights",
      pdpa: "Data handling"
    },
    monitoring: {
      access: "Usage tracking",
      breaches: "Incident detection",
      reporting: "Compliance reports"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Real-Time Features

### WebSocket Integration
```typescript
interface RealTimeSystem {
  attendance: {
    tracking: "Live attendance",
    updates: "Instant notifications",
    reporting: "Real-time stats"
  },
  communication: {
    messaging: "Instant messages",
    notifications: "Push alerts",
    presence: "Online status"
  },
  monitoring: {
    metrics: "Live statistics",
    alerts: "Instant warnings",
    status: "System health"
  }
}
```

## 5. Integration Points

### External Services
```typescript
interface ExternalIntegration {
  authentication: {
    oauth: "Google/Microsoft SSO",
    mfa: "Multi-factor providers",
    directory: "LDAP integration"
  },
  content: {
    youtube: "Video lectures",
    storage: "Cloud storage",
    cdn: "Content delivery"
  },
  communication: {
    email: "Email service",
    push: "Push notifications"
  }
}
```

## 6. Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Tracking
```typescript
interface PerformanceAnalytics {
  system: {
    metrics: "System performance",
    usage: "Resource utilization",
    availability: "Service uptime"
  },
  user: {
    activity: "User engagement",
    performance: "Learning metrics",
    satisfaction: "User feedback"
  },
  reporting: {
    realtime: "Live dashboards",
    scheduled: "Regular reports",
    alerts: "Threshold warnings"
  }
}
```
