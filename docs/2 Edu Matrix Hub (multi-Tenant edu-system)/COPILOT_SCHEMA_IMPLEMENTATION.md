# Copilot Implementation Guide: Schema Management System

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Schema Management System using GitHub Copilot. Follow these steps in order to build the complete system.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Setup

1. Open `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Add TenantSchema and SchemaOperation models for managing institution schemas with the following requirements:
   - Track schema status, storage usage, and quotas
   - Log all schema operations with timing
   - Include proper relations and enums
   ```

### Step 2: SQL Functions

1. Create directory: `sql/schema_management/`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Create PostgreSQL functions for institution schema management:
   1. create_institution_schema
   2. drop_institution_schema
   3. backup_institution_schema
   Include proper error handling and logging
   ```

### Step 3: Service Layer

1. Create: `lib/services/schema-management.ts`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Create a SchemaManagementService class that:
   - Interfaces with Prisma client
   - Implements schema CRUD operations
   - Handles maintenance operations
   - Includes proper error handling
   ```

### Step 4: API Routes

1. Create: `app/api/admin/schemas/route.ts`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Create Next.js API routes for schema management:
   - POST for creation
   - DELETE for removal
   - GET for listing
   - PATCH for operations
   Include proper validation and error handling
   ```

### Step 5: React Hook

1. Create: `hooks/useSchemaManagement.ts`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Create a React hook for schema management that:
   - Manages schema state
   - Provides CRUD operations
   - Handles loading states
   - Includes toast notifications
   ```

### Step 6: UI Components

1. Create: `components/2-Edu-Matrix-Hub/admin/SchemaManagement.tsx`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Create a React component for schema management that:
   - Displays schema list with status
   - Shows storage usage
   - Provides action buttons
   - Includes confirmation dialogs
   Use shadcn/ui components for styling
   ```

### Step 7: Utils and Helpers

1. Open: `lib/utils.ts`
2. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Add utility functions for:
   - Byte size formatting
   - Schema name validation
   - Status color mapping
   ```

## Testing Instructions

1. Unit Tests:
   ```
   Create unit tests for SchemaManagementService covering:
   - Schema creation
   - Schema deletion
   - Backup operations
   - Error cases
   ```

2. Integration Tests:
   ```
   Create integration tests for API routes testing:
   - Request validation
   - Response formats
   - Error handling
   - Operation flow
   ```

3. E2E Tests:
   ```
   Create Cypress tests for schema management UI:
   - Schema creation flow
   - Operation triggers
   - Error displays
   - Loading states
   ```

## Optimization Requests

1. Service Layer:
   ```
   Optimize SchemaManagementService for:
   - Connection pooling
   - Query batching
   - Error retry logic
   ```

2. UI Performance:
   ```
   Optimize SchemaManagement component for:
   - State updates
   - Re-render prevention
   - Data caching
   ```

## Security Enhancements

1. Access Control:
   ```
   Implement security measures:
   - Role-based access
   - Operation validation
   - Audit logging
   ```

2. Data Protection:
   ```
   Add data protection features:
   - Schema isolation
   - Backup encryption
   - Access logging
   ```

## Monitoring Setup

1. Performance Monitoring:
   ```
   Add monitoring for:
   - Operation timing
   - Resource usage
   - Error rates
   ```

2. Alert System:
   ```
   Implement alerts for:
   - Quota limits
   - Operation failures
   - Performance issues
   ```
