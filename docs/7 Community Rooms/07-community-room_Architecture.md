## Core Features
- Voice-based temporary chat rooms

- Maximum 6 users per room
- Client-side storage only

- P2P connections using WebRTC
- Automatic room management transfer
- No server-side storage required

## Technical Architecture

### WebRTC Implementation
```typescript
interface WebRTCArchitecture {
  signaling: {
    server: {
      type: "WebSocket",
      purpose: "Initial connection setup only",
      load: "Minimal - connection handshake",
      scaling: {
        type: "Horizontal",
        metric: "Connection count",
        threshold: "10k connections per instance"
      }
    },
    connections: {
      maxUsers: 6,
      topology: "Mesh",
      protocol: "Secure WebRTC"
    }
  },

  p2p: {
    audio: {
      codec: "Opus",
      bitrate: "32kbps",
      quality: "Voice optimized"
    },
    optimization: {
      bandwidth: "Adaptive bitrate",
      latency: "< 100ms target",
      fallback: "Quality degradation"
    }
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Storage
```typescript
interface StorageImplementation {
  temporary: {
    type: "IndexedDB",
    purpose: "Room state management",
    cleanup: "Auto cleanup on room close",
    sync: "P2P state synchronization"
  },
  
  state: {
    room: {
      id: "Unique identifier",
      participants: "Current users",
      admin: "Current admin",
      status: "Room state"
    },
    connections: {
      peers: "P2P connections",
      status: "Connection states",
      quality: "Audio metrics"
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Room Creation and Management
1. **Room Creation**:
   - First user creates a temporary voice chat room
   - Room details stored locally on creator's device
   - If room creator leaves, next user becomes admin
   - Seamless transfer of room management
   - No interruption in voice chat

### Security Implementation
```typescript
interface SecurityMeasures {
  encryption: {
    p2p: "End-to-end encryption",
    signaling: "TLS 1.3",
    storage: "AES-256"
  },
  
  privacy: {
    gdpr: {
      consent: "Audio permission only",
      storage: "Temporary, client-side only",
      deletion: "Automatic on room close"
    },
    dataHandling: {
      collection: "Minimal necessary data",
      retention: "Session duration only",
      protection: "P2P encryption"
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
interface MonitoringSystem {
  metrics: {
    voice: {
      quality: "MOS score",
      latency: "P2P delay",
      jitter: "Connection stability"
    },
    rooms: {
      active: "Current room count",
      users: "Connected users",
      transfers: "Admin handovers"
    }
  },
  
  analytics: {
    usage: "Room utilization",
    performance: "Connection quality",
    errors: "Connection failures"
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics
- Voice Quality: Clear audio transmission
- Latency: < 100ms for voice data
- Room Transfer: < 1s for admin handover

## UI Flow Implementation

### Home Screen (Lobby)
```typescript
interface LobbyInterface {
  display: {
    roomList: {
      type: "how user profiles are displayed",
      
      items: "Active voice rooms",
      perRoom: {
        name: "Room name",
        users: "Current/Max (6) users",
        status: "Active/Full indicator"
      }
    },
    actions: {
      create: "Create New Room button",
      refresh: "Auto-refresh list",
      search: "Search rooms"
    }
  },

  interactions: {
    join: "Click to join room",
    create: "Open create modal",
    hover: "Show room details"
  }
}
```

### Room Creation

  modal: {
    fields: {
      name: "Room name input",
      private: "Privacy toggle"
    },
    validation: {
      name: "Length & characters",
      availability: "Name uniqueness"
    }
  },

  process: {
    creation: "Generate room ID",
    storage: "Save to IndexedDB",
    broadcast: "Announce new room",
    join: "Auto-join creator"
  }
}
```

  layout: {
    header: {
      name: "Room name",
      users: "User count (6 max)",
      controls: "Admin controls"
    },
    participants: {
      list: "Connected users",
      status: "Voice indicators",
      roles: "Admin indicator"
    },
    controls: {
      audio: "Mute/Unmute",
      leave: "Exit room",
      admin: "Admin panel"
    }
  },

  adminControls: {
    userManagement: {
      mute: "Mute user",
      remove: "Remove user",
      transfer: "Transfer admin"
    },
    roomManagement: {
      close: "Close room",
      settings: "Room settings"
    }
  }
}
```

    }
  }

    join: "User connection",
    update: "State changes",
    leave: "User disconnection",
