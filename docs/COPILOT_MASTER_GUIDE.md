# EDU Matrix Interlinked - Copilot Master Guide

## 1. Project Context Understanding

### A. System Overview
```typescript
interface ProjectContext {
  type: "Enterprise Education Platform",
  scale: {
    users: "1M+ concurrent users",
    institutions: "10k+ educational institutions",
    dailyTransactions: {
      attendance: "1M+ records/day",
      examSubmissions: "100k+ submissions/day",
      classes: "100k+ active classes"
    }
  },
  architecture: {
    pattern: "True microservices with initial shared database",
    deployment: "Multi-region with auto-scaling",
    dataIsolation: "Schema-per-service with tenant isolation",
    realtime: "WebSocket + Kafka event streaming"
  },
  services: {
    matrixCollege: {
      type: "Core LMS Platform",
      features: {
        multiTenant: "Complete institution isolation",
        automation: "AI-powered exam grading",
        attendance: "Real-time tracking & reporting",
        roleBasedAccess: ["Institution Admin", "Department Head", "Teacher", "Student", "Parent"]
      }
    },
    studentsPlatform: {
      type: "Social Learning Network",
      features: {
        feed: "Academic social interactions",
        collaboration: "Peer learning system",
        content: "Educational resource sharing"
      }
    },
    coursePlatform: {
      type: "Learning Management",
      features: {
        courseDelivery: "Interactive learning",
        progress: "Student tracking",
        assessment: "Automated grading"
      }
    },
    freelancing: {
      type: "Educational Marketplace",
      features: {
        gigs: "Educational services",
        matching: "Skill-based pairing",
        payments: "Secure transactions"
      }
    },
    jobPortal: {
      type: "Career Platform",
      features: {
        listings: "Educational jobs",
        applications: "Career tracking",
        matching: "AI-powered recommendations"
      }
    },
    newsSystem: {
      type: "Educational Updates",
      features: {
        content: "Academic news",
        alerts: "Institution updates",
        notifications: "Real-time delivery"
      }
    },
    communityRooms: {
      type: "Discussion Platform",
      features: {
        rooms: "Topic-based discussions",
        moderation: "Content filtering",
        engagement: "Academic interactions"
      }
    },
    statistics: {
      type: "Analytics Engine",
      features: {
        metrics: "Performance tracking",
        insights: "Data visualization",
        reporting: "Custom analytics"
      }
    },
    feedback: {
      type: "User Experience",
      features: {
        collection: "Multi-channel feedback",
        analysis: "Sentiment tracking",
        improvements: "Action tracking"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Core Architecture Principles
1. Service Independence:
   ```typescript
   interface ServiceIsolation {
     codebase: "Complete separation",
     data: "Schema-per-service isolation",
     scaling: "Independent scalability",
     deployment: "Zero-downtime extraction"
   }
   ```

2. Data Strategy:
   ```typescript
   interface DataStrategy {
     initial: {
       database: "Shared PostgreSQL",
       isolation: "Schema per service",
       access: "Service-specific users"
     },
     future: {
       separation: "Zero-code-change extraction",
       migration: "Live replication with dual-write",
       consistency: "Event-driven synchronization"
     }
   }
   ```

## 2. Implementation Guidelines

### A. Service Architecture
```typescript
interface ServiceImplementation {
  structure: {
    app: {
      routes: "/(service-name)/*",
      api: "/api/(service-name)/*",
      handlers: "Service-specific logic"
    },
    lib: {
      models: "Service domain models",
      repositories: "Data access layer",
      events: "Domain events",
      utils: "Service utilities"
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Code Generation Rules
1. Service Routes:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Edu Matrix Hub Course Creation
   // WHY: Handle course management within college service
   // WHERE: /app/(matrix-college)/courses/route.ts
   // HOW: Implements course creation with schema isolation
   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     // Validate service context
     ensureServiceContext('matrix-college');
     
     // Use service-specific repository
     const repo = new CollegeCourseRepository();
     
     // Emit domain event
     await eventBus.emit('college.course.created');
   }
   ```

2. Data Access:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Service Repository Pattern
   // WHY: Maintain data isolation
   // WHERE: /lib/services/matrix-college/repositories
   // HOW: Implements schema-specific queries
   class BaseRepository {
     protected schema: string;
     
     constructor(schema: string) {
       this.schema = schema;
     }
     
     protected async query() {
       await prisma.$executeRaw`SET search_path TO ${this.schema}`;
       // Execute query within schema context
     }
   }
   ```

### B. Edu Matrix Hub Core Service Patterns

```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvents {

## 3. Cross-Service Patterns

### A. Error Handling
```typescript
interface ErrorHandling {
  // Service-specific error hierarchy
  errors: {
    base: "ServiceError",
    types: {
      validation: "ValidationError",
      authorization: "AuthorizationError",
      notFound: "NotFoundError",
      conflict: "ConflictError",
      system: "SystemError"
    },
    context: {
      service: "Service identifier",
      tenant: "Institution context",
      trace: "Error trace ID",
      timestamp: "Error occurrence time"
    }
  },

  // Error response structure
  response: {
    format: {
      status: "HTTP status code",
      code: "Error code",
      message: "User-friendly message",
      details: "Error specifics",
      help: "Resolution steps"
    },
    localization: {
      messages: "Translated strings",
      context: "Cultural adaptation",
      formatting: "Regional formats"
    }
  },

  // Error handling patterns
  handling: {
    validation: {
      schema: "Zod/Yup validation",
      context: "Tenant verification",
      access: "Permission check"
    },
    recovery: {
      retry: "Exponential backoff",
      fallback: "Graceful degradation",
      cleanup: "Resource cleanup"
    },
    logging: {
      levels: "DEBUG | INFO | WARN | ERROR",
      context: "Request context",
      metrics: "Error tracking"
    }
  },

  // Implementation example
  example: `
    class ServiceError extends Error {
      constructor(
        message: string,
        public code: string,
        public status: number,
        public context: {
          service: string;
          tenant?: string;
          trace: string;
          timestamp: Date;
        }
      ) {
        super(message);
        this.name = this.constructor.name;
        Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
      }
    }

    class ValidationError extends ServiceError {
      constructor(
        message: string,
        details: object,
        tenant?: string
      ) {
        super(message, 'VALIDATION_ERROR', 400, {
          service: 'current-service',
          tenant,
          trace: generateTraceId(),
          timestamp: new Date()
        });
        this.details = details;
      }
    }

    // Usage example
    try {
      throw new ValidationError(
        'Invalid course enrollment data',
        { field: 'studentId', issue: 'not_found' },
        'institution_123'
      );
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
        // Handle validation error
        logger.warn({
          message: error.message,
          code: error.code,
          context: error.context,
          details: error.details
        });
        
        // Return formatted error response
        return {
          status: error.status,
          error: {
            code: error.code,
            message: error.message,
            details: error.details,
            help: 'Please verify the student ID and try again'
          }
        };
      }
      
      // Handle other errors
      throw error;
    }
  `
}
```

### B. Security Implementation

        truncate: "Partial display",
        redact: "Complete hiding"

    },
    detection: {
      patterns: "Suspicious activity",
      thresholds: "Alert triggers",
      response: "Automated actions"
    }
  },

  // Implementation example
  example: `
    async function authorizeAction(

      resource: Resource
    ): Promise<boolean> {

                    key: url
  `
}
```

These deployment patterns ensure:

1. Multi-region availability
2. Zero-downtime updates
3. Auto-scaling capabilities
4. Database reliability
5. Performance monitoring
6. Resource optimization
7. Security compliance

## 4. Database Guidelines 

### A. Schema Management
```typescript
interface SchemaManagement {
  naming: "${service}_schema",
  access: {
    users: "Service-specific credentials",
    permissions: "Minimal required access",
    isolation: "No cross-schema queries"
  }
}
```

### B. Query Patterns:
```typescript
// Correct: Schema-isolated query
const courses = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SET search_path TO matrix_college_schema;
  SELECT * FROM courses WHERE institution_id = ${institutionId}
`;

// WRONG: Never do cross-schema queries
// const data = await prisma.otherService.findMany()
```

## 5. Security Implementation

### A. Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
interface SecurityPattern {
  auth: {
    validation: "Service context check",
    permissions: "Role-based access",
    sessions: "Tenant-aware tokens"
  },
  data: {
    encryption: "Field-level when needed",
    masking: "Sensitive data protection",
    audit: "Action logging enabled"
  }
}
```

## 6. Error Handling

### A. Service Errors
```typescript
// Example: Service-specific error handling
// WHY: Maintain clear error boundaries
// WHERE: Throughout service code
// HOW: Custom error classes per service
class MatrixCollegeError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string,
    public context: any
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

## 7. Performance Optimization

### A. Caching Strategy
```typescript
interface CachingPattern {
  layers: {
    browser: "Service-specific cache",
    server: "Redis per service",
    database: "Query result cache"
  }
}
```

### B. Implementation:
```typescript
// Example: Service caching
// WHY: Optimize service performance
// WHERE: Service repositories
// HOW: Multi-layer caching
async function getCourseData(id: string) {
  // Check service cache first
  const cached = await redis.get(`matrix-college:course:${id}`);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  // Query with schema isolation
  const data = await prisma.$queryRaw`
    SET search_path TO matrix_college_schema;
    SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id = ${id}
  `;
  
  // Cache in service namespace
  await redis.set(`matrix-college:course:${id}`, JSON.stringify(data));
  return data;
}
```

### D. Integration Testing
```typescript
interface TestingPatterns {
  // Service integration testing
  integration: {
    scopes: {
      service: {
        internal: "Within service boundaries",
        external: "Cross-service communication",
        database: "Data persistence"
      },
      tenant: {
        isolation: "Multi-tenant separation",
        interaction: "Cross-tenant prevention",
        cleanup: "Test data management"
      }
    },
    scenarios: {
      flows: {
        academic: "Educational processes",
        administrative: "Management tasks",
        communication: "Real-time features"
      },
      conditions: {
        success: "Happy path flows",
        failure: "Error handling",
        edge: "Boundary conditions"
      }
    }
  },

  // Test environment management
  environments: {
    setup: {
      database: {
        seeding: "Test data creation",
        cleanup: "Automatic teardown",
        isolation: "Per-test schema"
      },
      services: {
        mocking: "External dependencies",
        stubs: "Network services",
        containers: "Isolated runtime"
      }
    },
    data: {
      generation: {
        factories: "Test data builders",
        fixtures: "Common scenarios",
        snapshots: "State capture"
      },
      constraints: {
        referential: "Data relationships",
        validation: "Business rules",
        consistency: "State management"
      }
    }
  },

  // Example implementation
  example: `
    describe('Course Enrollment Integration', () => {
      // Test environment setup
      const testEnv = new TestEnvironment({
        services: ['matrix-college', 'course-platform'],
        tenants: ['test-institution-1', 'test-institution-2']
      });

      beforeAll(async () => {
        await testEnv.setup();
        await testEnv.seedData({
          institutions: institutionFactory.buildList(2),
          courses: courseFactory.buildList(5),
          students: studentFactory.buildList(10)
        });
      });

      afterAll(async () => {
        await testEnv.teardown();
      });

      it('should handle cross-service enrollment flow', async () => {
        // Arrange
        const student = await studentFactory.build();
        const course = await courseFactory.build();
        
        // Act
        const result = await enrollmentService.enroll({
          studentId: student.id,
          courseId: course.id,
          institutionId: 'test-institution-1'
        });

        // Assert - Edu Matrix Hub
        const matrixRecord = await matrixService.getEnrollment(result.id);
        expect(matrixRecord).toMatchObject({
          status: 'active',
          student: student.id,
          course: course.id
        });

        // Assert - Course Platform
        const courseAccess = await coursePlatform.getStudentAccess(
          student.id,
          course.id
        );
        expect(courseAccess).toMatchObject({
          granted: true,
          materials: 'accessible',
          progress: 0
        });

        // Assert - Events
        expect(testEnv.getEmittedEvents()).toContainEqual({
          type: 'enrollment.created',
          payload: {
            student: student.id,
            course: course.id
          }
        });
      });

      it('should maintain tenant isolation', async () => {
        // Arrange
        const tenant1Student = await studentFactory.build({
          institutionId: 'test-institution-1'
        });
        const tenant2Course = await courseFactory.build({
          institutionId: 'test-institution-2'
        });

        // Act & Assert
        await expect(
          enrollmentService.enroll({
            studentId: tenant1Student.id,
            courseId: tenant2Course.id
          })
        ).rejects.toThrow('Cross-institution enrollment not allowed');
      });
    });
  `
}
```

These testing patterns ensure:

1. Proper service integration
2. Multi-tenant isolation
3. Data consistency
4. Event handling
5. Error scenarios
6. Performance validation
7. Security compliance

## 8. Testing Guidelines

### A. Service Tests
```typescript
// Example: Service-specific test
// WHY: Validate service behavior
// WHERE: Service test files
// HOW: Isolated service testing
describe('MatrixCollege Service', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set service context
    setTestContext('matrix-college');
    
    // Use service schema
    mockDatabase.setSchema('matrix_college_schema');
  });
  
  it('should create course in isolation', async () => {
    // Test with service boundaries
  });
});
```

## 9. Critical Reminders

### A. Never Generate:
1. Cross-service imports
2. Cross-schema queries
3. Shared state between services
4. Direct service-to-service calls

### B. Always Generate:
1. Service-specific repositories
2. Schema-isolated queries
3. Event-driven communication
4. Clear service boundaries

This guide serves as the definitive reference for GitHub Copilot to maintain true microservices architecture while generating code. Follow these patterns strictly to ensure proper service isolation and maintainable code structure.

### F. Observability Patterns
```typescript
interface ObservabilityPatterns {
  // Logging strategy
  logging: {
    levels: {
      application: {
        error: "System failures",
        warn: "Potential issues",
        info: "State changes",
        debug: "Detailed flow"
      },
      security: {
        critical: "Breaches",
        alert: "Suspicious activity",
        audit: "Access logs"
      },
      business: {
        transaction: "Core operations",
        user: "User actions",
        system: "Automated tasks"
      }
    },
    context: {
      request: {
        trace: "Correlation ID",
        user: "Actor context",
        tenant: "Institution ID"
      },
      performance: {
        timing: "Duration metrics",
        resources: "Usage stats",
        dependencies: "External calls"
      }
    }
  },

  // Tracing implementation
  tracing: {
    spans: {
      http: {
        incoming: "API requests",
        outgoing: "External calls",
        internal: "Service calls"
      },
      database: {
        queries: "SQL operations",
        cache: "Redis operations",
        search: "Search queries"
      }
    },
    sampling: {
      rules: {
        error: "All errors",
        latency: "Slow requests",
        random: "Statistical sample"
      },
      rates: {
        production: "1% of traffic",
        staging: "10% of traffic",
        development: "100% of traffic"
      }
    }
  },

  // Metrics collection
  metrics: {
    system: {
      resources: {
        cpu: "Utilization rates",
        memory: "Usage patterns",
        disk: "IO operations"
      },
      network: {
        throughput: "Data transfer",
        latency: "Response times",
        errors: "Failed requests"
      }
    },
    application: {
      performance: {
        response: "Request timing",
        throughput: "Request rate",
        errors: "Failure count"
      },
      business: {
        users: "Active sessions",
        operations: "Transaction volume",
        features: "Usage patterns"
      }
    }
  },

  // Implementation example
  example: `
    // Trace middleware
    async function traceMiddleware(
      req: Request,
      res: Response,
      next: NextFunction
    ) {
      const traceId = req.headers['x-trace-id'] || generateTraceId();
      const spanId = generateSpanId();
      
      // Start span
      const span = tracer.startSpan('http_request', {
        traceId,
        spanId,
        attributes: {
          service: 'matrix-college-api',
          method: req.method,
          path: req.path,
          tenant: req.institution_id
        }
      });

      // Timing metrics
      const startTime = process.hrtime();

      // Response interceptor
      const originalEnd = res.end;
      res.end = function(...args) {
        // Calculate duration
        const [seconds, nanoseconds] = process.hrtime(startTime);
        const duration = seconds * 1000 + nanoseconds / 1000000;

        // Record metrics
        metrics.recordHttpRequest({
          method: req.method,
          path: req.path,
          status: res.statusCode,
          duration
        });

        // End span
        span.setAttributes({
          status: res.statusCode,
          error: res.statusCode >= 400,
          duration
        });
        span.end();

        // Structured logging
        logger.info('http_request_completed', {
          trace_id: traceId,
          span_id: spanId,
          method: req.method,
          path: req.path,
          status: res.statusCode,
          duration,
          user: req.user?.id,
          tenant: req.institution_id
        });

        originalEnd.apply(res, args);
      };

      // Continue request
      req.traceId = traceId;
      req.spanId = spanId;
      next();
    }
  `
}
```

These observability patterns ensure:

1. Comprehensive logging
2. Distributed tracing
3. Business metrics
4. Performance monitoring
5. Error tracking
6. User analytics
7. System health visibility
