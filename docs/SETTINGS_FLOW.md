# Project Settings Flow Guide

## Current Settings Overview

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- Located in `tsconfig.json`
- Uses Next.js 15.2.1 with Turbopack
- Strict type checking enabled
- Configured for modern ES2021 features
- Uses path aliases with `@/*` mapping

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Located in `.env` and `lib/env.ts`
- Key components:
  - Database (PostgreSQL)
  - Redis Caching
  - Authentication (NextAuth.js)
  - Email Service (Resend)
  - Image Storage (ImageKit)

### 3. Code Quality Tools
- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pretty TypeScript Errors for better error reporting

## Settings Flow

### Development Environment Flow
1. Environment Variables Load
   ```
   .env → lib/env.ts → Application
   ```

2. Type Checking Flow
   ```
   tsconfig.json → TypeScript → Pretty TypeScript Errors → VS Code
   ```

3. Code Formatting Flow
   ```
   prettier.config.js → ESLint → VS Code
   ```

## Potential Conflicts and Solutions

### 1. Next.js and TypeScript
- **Issue**: Module resolution conflicts with `@/*` paths
- **Solution**: Already resolved through proper tsconfig.json configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly

### 2. Authentication Dependencies
- **Issue**: Peer dependency conflicts between next-auth and @auth/core
- **Solution**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` during installation
- **Status**: ⚠️ Temporary solution, needs version alignment

### 3. ESLint and Prettier
- **Issue**: No conflicts detected
- **Solution**: Properly configured through eslint-config-prettier
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly

### 4. Redis Connection
- **Issue**: Potential connection issues in development
- **Solution**: Ensure Redis is running via Docker
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly

## Critical Issues Found

### Authentication Dependencies
- **Critical Conflict**: Incompatible versions between authentication packages
  ```
  next-auth@4.24.11 requires @auth/core@0.34.2
  @auth/prisma-adapter@2.8.0 requires @auth/core@0.38.0
  ```
- **Impact**: This conflict affects both development and production builds
- **Solution Options**:
  1. Downgrade @auth/prisma-adapter to match next-auth's requirements
  2. Use `--legacy-peer-deps` temporarily (not recommended for production)
  3. Upgrade next-auth when a compatible version is available

### Recommended Actions
1. Authentication System:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Downgrade @auth/prisma-adapter (Recommended)
   npm uninstall @auth/prisma-adapter
   npm install @auth/prisma-adapter@~2.7.0

   # Option 2: Temporary fix (Development only)
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Environment Variables:
   - Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is properly set
   - Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL matches your deployment URL

3. Database Configuration:
   - Validate DATABASE_URL connection string
   - Check Prisma schema compatibility

### Configuration Health Check
- ✅ TypeScript configuration is valid
- ✅ Prettier formatting is working
- ✅ ESLint core configuration is valid
- ⚠️ Authentication package versions need attention
- ✅ Environment variables are properly structured
- ✅ Redis configuration is valid

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Start Development Services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Run Development Server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Validation Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation working
- [x] ESLint rules applied
- [x] Prettier formatting working
- [x] Environment variables loaded
- [x] Redis connection established
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] Next.js dev server running
- [x] Authentication flow working

## Current Project Status
- Core functionality works but requires attention to authentication dependencies
- ESLint and Prettier are properly configured for code quality
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled and functioning
- Development environment is stable with Docker services

## Recommendations

1. Consider upgrading next-auth to resolve peer dependency issues
2. Monitor Redis memory usage in development
3. Keep environment variables synchronized between development and production
4. Regularly update ESLint and TypeScript for security patches
