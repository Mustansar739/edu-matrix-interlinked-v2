# Comment Style Guide

## Comment Best Practices

### 1. Why Over What
- Focus on explaining WHY something exists
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs
- Document non-obvious implementations
- Include security and performance notes

### 2. Keep Updated
- Comments must be treated as code
- Update when implementation changes
- Remove outdated comments
- Verify accuracy regularly

### 3. Be Concise
- Use clear, precise language
- Avoid obvious comments
- Focus on important details
- Use examples for clarity

### 4. Include Examples
- Provide usage examples
- Show common patterns
- Demonstrate edge cases
- Include error handling

### 5. Document Trade-offs
- Explain design decisions
- Note performance implications
- Document security considerations
- List known limitations

## Real Project Examples

### 1. Component Example
```typescript
/**
 * @component FeeManagementDashboard
 * @description
 * Provides a comprehensive interface for managing student fees.
 * Handles fee structure creation, payment tracking, and reporting.
 * Uses real-time updates for payment status changes.
 * 
 * @props
 * - institutionId: string - Institution identifier
 * - userRole: UserRole - Current user's role
 * - filters: FeeFilters - Optional display filters
 * 
 * @performance
 * - Uses React.memo for expensive calculations
 * - Implements infinite scrolling for large datasets
 * - Caches fee structures in Redis
 * 
 * @security
 * - Validates user permissions
 * - Sanitizes payment data
 * - Logs all financial transactions
 */
```

### 2. API Example
```typescript
/**
 * @api {post} /api/fees/process Process Fee Payment
 * @description
 * Processes a student fee payment through multiple payment gateways.
 * Supports Stripe, JazzCash, and bank transfers.
 * Implements retry logic for failed transactions.
 * 
 * @auth Required, Admin or Teacher
 * @access Institution-specific
 * 
 * @param {PaymentRequest} request - Payment details
 * @returns {PaymentResponse} Transaction result
 * @throws {PaymentError} On payment failure
 * 
 * @performance
 * - Implements idempotency
 * - Uses transaction queuing
 * - Caches payment status
 * 
 * @security
 * - Validates payment source
 * - Encrypts transaction data
 * - Implements rate limiting
 */
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Adding Comments
- Add comments during development
- Review comments in code review
- Update affected comments
- Remove obsolete comments

### 2. Verification
- Check comment accuracy
- Verify examples work
- Update outdated information
- Maintain consistency

### 3. Tools Integration
- Use TypeScript for better docs
- Implement ESLint rules
- Use documentation generators
- Automate comment checks

### 4. AI-Assisted Development
- Add context for AI tools
- Include business logic explanations
- Document constraints clearly
- Explain architectural decisions

### 5. Test Generation
- Include test scenarios
- Document edge cases
- Specify test requirements
- Define integration tests

### 6. Performance Documentation
- Define performance requirements
- Document optimization strategies
- Specify monitoring needs
- Include benchmarks

## Comment Style Guide Updates
- Updated comment conventions used across code and documentation.
- Included examples for inline, multiline, and documentation comments.
