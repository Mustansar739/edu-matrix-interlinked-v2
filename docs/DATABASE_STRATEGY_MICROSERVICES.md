# Database Strategy for Microservices Architecture

## 1. Core Service Schemas
1. students_platform_schema (Students Interlinked)
2. edu_matrix_hub_schema (Institution Management)
3. courses_platform_schema (Course Management)
4. freelancing_schema (Freelance Platform)
5. jobs_portal_schema (Job Portal)
6. news_system_schema (Educational News)
7. community_rooms_schema (Chat System)
8. statistics_schema (Platform Analytics)
9. feedback_schema (User Feedback)

## 2. Schema Isolation Strategy
```typescript
interface SchemaStrategy {
  isolation: {
    tenant: "institution_id in all tables";
    permissions: "Schema-specific users";
    migrations: "Independent per schema";
  };
  
  security: {
    rls: "Row-level security";
    encryption: "Column encryption";
    audit: "Change tracking";
  };
}
```

## 2. Data Access Patterns

### A. Service Isolation
```typescript
interface ServiceIsolation {
  connections: {
    pooling: {
      size: "Service-specific sizing",
      timeout: "30 seconds max",
      idleTimeout: "10 minutes"
    },
    monitoring: {
      metrics: ["Active connections", "Wait time", "Query duration"],
      alerts: "80% pool utilization"
    }
  },

  transactions: {
    scope: "Single schema only",
    timeout: "5 seconds default",
    retryPolicy: "Exponential backoff"
  }
}
```

### B. Cross-Service Communication
1. Event-Driven Updates:
   - Kafka for asynchronous events
   - No direct cross-schema queries
   - Event sourcing for critical flows
   - CQRS pattern implementation

2. Data Consistency:
   - Eventually consistent model
   - Service-specific caching
   - Versioned events
   - Idempotent handlers

## 3. Scaling Triggers & Extraction Strategy

### A. Monitoring Metrics
```typescript
interface ScalingMetrics {
  performance: {
    queryTime: "> 100ms average",
    cpu: "> 70% sustained",
    memory: "> 80% usage",
    connections: "> 75% pool"
  },

  storage: {
    capacity: "> 80% used",
    growth: "> 10% monthly",
    wal: "> 50GB size",
    backup: "< 1 hour window"
  }
}
```

### B. Extraction Process
1. Pre-Extraction Phase:
   - Deploy database proxy layer
   - Set up monitoring baseline
   - Prepare new instance
   - Test restoration procedures

2. Migration Phase:
   - Schema clone to new instance
   - Set up logical replication
   - Implement dual-write pattern
   - Validate data consistency
   - Zero-downtime cutover

3. Post-Migration:
   - Monitor performance
   - Verify data integrity
   - Update documentation
   - Cleanup old schema

## 4. Security & Compliance

### A. Data Protection
```typescript
interface SecurityMeasures {
  encryption: {
    atRest: "AES-256",
    inTransit: "TLS 1.3",
    backups: "Encrypted with rotation"
  },

  access: {
    authentication: "Certificate + password",
    authorization: "Schema-level RBAC",
    audit: "Query logging enabled"
  },

  compliance: {
    gdpr: {
      deletion: "Right to be forgotten",
      export: "Data portability",
      logging: "Access tracking"
    },
    backup: {
      retention: "30 days minimum",
      testing: "Monthly validation",
      recovery: "4-hour SLA"
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Monitoring & Alerting
1. Performance Metrics:
   - Query execution times
   - Connection pool status
   - Lock contentions
   - Buffer cache hits

2. Security Alerts:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Privilege escalations
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Schema modifications

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### A. Schema Management
```typescript
interface SchemaGuidelines {
  naming: {
    tables: "${service}_${entity}",
    functions: "${service}_fn_${action}",
    triggers: "${service}_trg_${event}"
  },

  versioning: {
    migrations: "Sequential numbering",
    rollback: "Always included",
    testing: "Automated validation"
  }
}
```

### B. Connection Management
1. Service Configuration:
   - Environment-based credentials
   - Connection pool settings
   - Timeout configurations
   - Retry policies

2. Operational Procedures:
   - Schema updates
   - Index maintenance
   - Statistics updates
   - Vacuum scheduling

## 6. Backup & Recovery Strategy

### A. Backup Procedures
```typescript
interface BackupStrategy {
  full: {
    schedule: "Daily at 00:00 UTC",
    retention: "30 days",
    validation: "Weekly restore test"
  },

  incremental: {
    schedule: "Every 6 hours",
    retention: "7 days",
    validation: "Daily consistency check"
  },

  pointInTime: {
    wal: "Continuous archiving",
    retention: "7 days",
    testing: "Monthly validation"
  }
}
```

### B. Recovery Procedures
1. Service Level Recovery:
   - Schema-specific restore
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Data validation steps
   - Service verification

2. Full Database Recovery:
   - Multi-phase restoration
   - Service priority order
   - Consistency validation
   - Performance verification

## 7. Documentation Requirements

### A. Schema Documentation
1. Service Definitions:
   - Entity relationships
   - Index strategies
   - Partition schemes
   - Growth projections

2. Operational Procedures:
   - Backup verification
   - Performance tuning
   - Trouble shooting
   - Emergency responses

### B. Migration Documentation
1. Service Extraction:
   - Pre-migration checklist
   - Execution procedures
   - Validation steps
   - Rollback plans

2. Performance Baselines:
   - Query patterns
   - Resource utilization
   - Growth trends
   - Scaling thresholds

## 8. Future Considerations

### A. Multi-Region Strategy
```typescript
interface MultiRegionStrategy {
  deployment: {
    primary: "Main application region",
    replicas: "Read-only instances",
    sync: "Async replication",
    failover: "Automated promotion"
  },

  dataSync: {
    method: "Logical replication",
    latency: "< 100ms target",
    monitoring: "Lag alerts",
    recovery: "Point-in-time capable"
  }
}
```

### B. Scaling Patterns
1. Vertical Scaling:
   - Resource allocation
   - Connection limits
   - Buffer settings
   - Storage optimization

2. Horizontal Scaling:
   - Read replicas
   - Service separation
   - Cross-region deployment
   - Load balancing

This document serves as the primary reference for database architecture decisions and implementation guidelines. All services must adhere to these patterns for consistent scaling and maintenance.
