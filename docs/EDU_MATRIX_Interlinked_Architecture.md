interface LoadHandlingStrategy {
  // Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
  kubernetes: {
    minReplicas: 3;
    maxReplicas: 10;
    targetCPUUtilization: 70;
    targetMemoryUtilization: 80;
  };

  // Geographic Distribution
  cdn: {
    staticAssets: CloudflareCDN;
    images: CloudflareImages;
    videos: YouTubeHosting;
  };

  // Database Scaling
  database: {
    readReplicas: PostgresReadReplicas[];
    sharding: {
      strategy: "per-tenant";
      shardKey: "tenantId";
    };
    connectionPools: {
      min: 5;
      max: 20;
    };
  };
}
```

### 2. Caching Strategy

```typescript
interface CachingArchitecture {
  // Multi-Layer Caching
  layers: {
    browser: {
      localStorage: "UI State";
      sessionStorage: "User Session";
      serviceWorker: "Offline Access";
    };

    cdn: {
      assets: "Static Files";
      images: "Optimized Images";
      api: "API Responses";
    };

    server: {
      redis: {
        session: "User Sessions";
        queries: "Database Queries";
        realtime: "WebSocket State";
      };
    };
  };

  // Cache Invalidation
  invalidation: {
    strategy: "stale-while-revalidate";
    ttl: {
      short: 300; // 5 minutes
      medium: 3600; // 1 hour
      long: 86400; // 1 day
    };
  };
}
```

### 3. Rate Limiting & Protection

```typescript
interface TrafficProtection {
  // Rate Limiting
  rateLimit: {
    api: {
      windowMs: 900000; // 15 minutes
      max: 100; // requests per window
    };
    auth: {
      windowMs: 3600000; // 1 hour
      max: 5; // login attempts
    };
    upload: {
      windowMs: 3600000; // 1 hour
      maxFileSize: 5; // MB
    };
  };

  // DDoS Protection
  ddos: {
    cloudflare: {
      enabled: true;
      securityLevel: "medium";
    };
    customRules: {
      threshold: 1000; // requests per minute
      blockDuration: 3600; // 1 hour
    };
  };
}
```

### 4. Database Optimization

```typescript
interface DatabaseOptimization {
  // Query Optimization
  queries: {
    indexing: {
      strategy: "compound-selective";
      autoVacuum: true;
    };
    caching: {
      results: RedisCacheLayer;
      procedures: PostgresqlCache;
    };
  };

  // Connection Management
  connections: {
    pooling: {
      min: 5;
      max: 20;
      idleTimeout: 10000;
    };
    readReplicas: {
      enabled: true;
      count: 3;
    };
  };
}
```

### 5. Monitoring & Auto-Scaling

```typescript
interface TrafficMonitoring {
  metrics: {
    // Real-time Metrics
    realtime: {
      concurrentUsers: "Active users count";
      responseTime: "API response times";
      errorRates: "Error percentage";
      resourceUsage: "CPU/Memory usage";
    };

    // Auto-scaling Triggers
    triggers: {
      cpu: {
        threshold: 70; // 70% CPU usage
        scaleUp: 2; // Add 2 replicas
        cooldown: 300; // 5 minutes
      };
      memory: {
        threshold: 80; // 80% memory usage
        scaleUp: 2; // Add 2 replicas
        cooldown: 300; // 5 minutes
      };
    };
  };

  // Health Checks
  health: {
    endpoints: HealthCheckEndpoints;
    intervals: HealthCheckIntervals;
    actions: AutoRecoveryActions;
  };
}
```

      replica: 6; // 2 replicas per master
    };
    shardSize: "10GB per shard";
    keySpace: 16384; // Redis hash slots
    distribution: "Hash slot distribution";
  };

  persistence: {
    rdb: {

      compression: true;
    };
    aof: {
      fsync: "everysec";
      rewrite: "Auto at 100% growth";
    };
  };

  highAvailability: {
    sentinels: 3;
    quorum: 2;
    failover: "Automatic";
    timeout: "5 seconds";
  };
}
```

### 2. Caching Strategy

    policy: "allkeys-lru";
    reserved: "20% free minimum";
  };

  monitoring: {
