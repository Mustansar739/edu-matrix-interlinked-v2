# Financial Monitoring System

## 1. Cost Tracking Architecture

### Infrastructure Cost Monitoring
```typescript
interface InfrastructureCosts {
  compute: {
    servers: {
      tracking: "Per-instance costs";
      optimization: "Auto-scaling metrics";
      forecasting: "ML-based predictions";
    };
    database: {
      storage: "Data volume costs";
      operations: "Query cost analysis";
      optimization: "Index usage stats";
    };
  };

  network: {
    bandwidth: {
      monitoring: "Traffic analysis";
      optimization: "CDN usage";
      regions: "Geographic distribution";
    };
    services: {
      cdn: "Content delivery costs";
      dns: "Domain management";
      ssl: "Certificate management";
    };
  };
}
```

### Operating Cost Analysis
```typescript
interface OperatingCosts {
  services: {
    thirdParty: {
      payment: "Gateway fees tracking";
      apis: "External service costs";
      licenses: "Software subscriptions";
    };
    maintenance: {
      updates: "System maintenance";
      support: "Technical support";
      security: "Security services";
    };
  };

  optimization: {
    automation: "Process automation";
    efficiency: "Resource utilization";
    reduction: "Cost-saving measures";
  };
}
```

## 2. Revenue Tracking System

### Donation Analytics
```typescript
interface DonationMetrics {
  tracking: {
    realTime: {
      volume: "Transaction count";
      value: "Amount metrics";
      sources: "Channel analysis";
    };
    trends: {
      daily: "Day-over-day growth";
      monthly: "Month-over-month";
      seasonal: "Pattern analysis";
    };
  };

  optimization: {
    conversion: "Rate improvement";
    retention: "Donor loyalty";
    engagement: "Community participation";
  };
}
```

### Financial Reporting
```typescript
interface FinancialReports {
  statements: {
    income: "Revenue/expense tracking";
    cashFlow: "Cash position analysis";
    balance: "Asset/liability tracking";
  };

  analytics: {
    metrics: "KPI dashboard";
    forecasts: "Future projections";
    variances: "Budget analysis";
  };
}
```

## 3. Cost Optimization Strategy

### Resource Optimization
```typescript
interface ResourceOptimization {
  compute: {
    scaling: "Dynamic provisioning";
    utilization: "Resource efficiency";
    scheduling: "Workload management";
  };

  storage: {
    tiering: "Data lifecycle management";
    compression: "Storage optimization";
    cleanup: "Automated maintenance";
  };
}
```

### Service Optimization
```typescript
interface ServiceOptimization {
  external: {
    evaluation: "Service cost-benefit";
    negotiation: "Provider contracts";
    alternatives: "Service comparison";
  };

  internal: {
    efficiency: "Process optimization";
    automation: "Task automation";
    consolidation: "Service integration";
  };
}
```

## 4. Monitoring & Alerts

### Cost Monitoring
```typescript
interface CostMonitoring {
  realTime: {
    tracking: "Live cost tracking";
    alerts: "Threshold notifications";
    trends: "Pattern detection";
  };

  reporting: {
    daily: "Cost summaries";
    monthly: "Detailed analysis";
    forecast: "Future projections";
  };
}
```

### Alert System
```typescript
interface AlertSystem {
  triggers: {
    thresholds: "Cost limits";
    anomalies: "Unusual patterns";
    trends: "Growth alerts";
  };

  notification: {
    channels: ["Email", "SMS", "Dashboard"];
    priority: "Alert severity";
    escalation: "Response protocol";
  };
}
```

## 5. Integration Points

### Core System Integration
```typescript
interface SystemIntegration {
  donation: {
    tracking: "Transaction monitoring";
    reconciliation: "Payment matching";
    reporting: "Financial summaries";
  };

  platform: {
    metrics: "Usage statistics";
    costs: "Resource utilization";
    optimization: "Efficiency tracking";
  };
}
```

### External Integration
```typescript
interface ExternalIntegration {
  accounting: {
    software: "Accounting system";
    taxation: "Tax compliance";
    audit: "External auditors";
  };

  banking: {
    reconciliation: "Bank statements";
    forecasting: "Cash flow planning";
    reporting: "Financial reports";
  };
}
```

## 6. Compliance & Security

### Financial Compliance
```typescript
interface ComplianceSystem {
  standards: {

    ifrs: "Financial reporting";
    sox: "Internal controls";
  };

  reporting: {
    statutory: "Legal requirements";
    regulatory: "Compliance reports";
