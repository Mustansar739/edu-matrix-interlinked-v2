# Service Boundaries Strategy

## 1. Core Services

### Students Interlinked Service
- Social feed management
- User interactions
- Content distribution
- Real-time updates

### Edu Matrix Hub Service
- Institution management
- Multi-tenant system
- Attendance tracking
- AI-powered exams
- Course management

### Course Platform Service
- Course listings
- Enrollment management
- Material distribution
- Progress tracking

## 2. Service Communication

### A. Event-Driven Architecture
```typescript
interface ServiceCommunication {
  patterns: {
    async: {
      broker: "Kafka message broker",
      topics: "Service-specific topics",
      events: "Domain events only"
    },
    sync: {
      gateway: "API Gateway",
      protocol: "REST/gRPC",
      auth: "Service-to-service auth"
    }
  }
}
```

### B. Implementation Rules
1. Complete Independence:
   - Separate repositories
   - Independent deployments
   - Service-specific databases
   - No shared code

2. Event Communication:
   - Domain event contracts
   - Event versioning
   - Independent handlers
   - Error isolation

## 3. Data Independence

### A. Database Separation
```typescript
interface DataIndependence {
  initial: {
    schema: "Service-specific schema",
    access: "Service-owned credentials",
    migrations: "Independent management"
  },
  future: {
    database: "Separate database per service",
    scaling: "Independent scaling",
    backup: "Service-specific backups"
  }
}
```

### B. Implementation Guidelines
1. Data Ownership:
   - Complete data autonomy
   - Independent schemas
   - Service-specific backups
   - Isolated recovery

2. Data Access:
   - No shared connections
   - Independent credentials
   - Service-specific caching
   - Isolated transactions

## 4. Infrastructure Independence

### A. Resource Management
```typescript
interface ServiceInfrastructure {
  compute: {
    scaling: "Independent auto-scaling",
    resources: "Service-specific limits"
  },
  storage: {
    database: "Dedicated instances",
    caching: "Service-specific Redis"
  }
}
```

### B. Implementation Rules
1. Service Resources:
   - Independent scaling rules
   - Service-specific monitoring
   - Dedicated resources
   - Isolated networking

2. Infrastructure:
   - Service-specific clusters
   - Independent load balancers
   - Dedicated caching
   - Isolated queues

## 5. Service Extraction Process

### A. Growth Indicators
```typescript
interface ScalingTriggers {
  metrics: {
    load: "Service-specific thresholds",
    growth: "Independent scaling needs",
    performance: "Service-level SLAs"
  }
}
```

### B. Extraction Steps
1. Database Separation:
   - Clone service schema
   - Set up new database
   - Migrate service data
   - Update connections

2. Infrastructure Setup:
   - Deploy service containers
   - Configure networking
   - Set up monitoring
   - Update service discovery

## 6. Monitoring & Metrics

### A. Independent Monitoring
```typescript
interface ServiceMetrics {
  dashboards: {
    metrics: "Service-specific KPIs",
    alerts: "Independent thresholds",
    logging: "Service-level logs"
  }
}
```

### B. Implementation Guidelines
1. Service Monitoring:
   - Independent dashboards
   - Service-specific alerts
   - Dedicated log streams
   - Custom health checks

2. Performance Tracking:
   - Service-level SLAs
   - Independent scaling
   - Custom metrics
   - Error tracking

This document serves as the definitive guide for implementing true microservices architecture. Each service must maintain complete independence in code, data, and infrastructure while communicating through well-defined events and APIs.
