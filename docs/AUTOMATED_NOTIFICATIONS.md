# Automated Notification System

## 1. Event Sources

### A. Educational Events
```typescript
interface EduMatrixEvents {
  attendance: {
    marked: "Daily attendance marked",
    absent: "Student absence alert",
    report: "Weekly/monthly reports"
  };
  exams: {
    scheduled: "New exam announcement",
    graded: "Results published",
    aiGrading: "AI assessment complete"
  };
  courses: {
    assigned: "New course assignment",
    deadline: "Assignment due soon",
    feedback: "Teacher feedback posted"
  };
}
```

## 2. Notification Center UI
```typescript
interface NotificationCenter {
  header: {
    title: "Notifications";
    controls: {
      markAllRead: "Mark all as read button";
      filter: "Filter notifications dropdown";
    };
  };

  notificationList: {
    layout: "Scrollable vertical list";
    sorting: "Newest first";
    grouping: "Group by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week)";
    maxItems: 100; // Last 100 notifications
    loadMore: "Infinite scroll";
  };

  notificationItem: {
    avatar: "Source icon/image";
    content: "Rich text with highlights";
    timestamp: "Relative time (2m, 1h, 2d)";
    status: "Read/Unread indicator";
    actions: "Quick action buttons";
  };
}
```

## 3. Notification Types & Icons
```typescript
interface NotificationTypes {
  academic: {
    examResults: {
      icon: "📝";
      color: "green";
      priority: "high";
    };
    
    attendance: {
      icon: "📊";
      color: "blue";
      priority: "normal";
    };

    assignments: {
      icon: "📚";
      color: "purple";
      priority: "high";
    };
  };

  financial: {
    feeReminders: {
      icon: "💰";
      color: "orange";
      priority: "high";
    };
    
    payments: {
      icon: "✅";
      color: "green";
      priority: "normal";
    };
  };

  administrative: {
    announcements: {
      icon: "📢";
      color: "blue";
      priority: "normal";
    };
    
    requests: {
      icon: "⚡";
      color: "red";
      priority: "urgent";
    };
  };
}
```

## 4. Role-Based Notifications

### Admin Notifications
```typescript
interface AdminNotifications {
  highPriority: {
    teacherAbsence: "Teacher reported absent";
    lowAttendance: "Class attendance below 75%";
    examResults: "New results need review";
    systemAlerts: "Technical issues detected";
  };

  administrative: {
    newEnrollments: "New student registrations";
    teacherRequests: "Teacher leave applications";
    parentMeetings: "Meeting requests";
    reports: "Daily/Weekly reports ready";
  };
}
```

### Teacher Notifications
```typescript
interface TeacherNotifications {
  classRelated: {
    attendance: "Attendance marking reminder";
    submissions: "New assignment submissions";
    queries: "Student questions";
    results: "Exam grading pending";
  };

  administrative: {
    meetings: "Staff meeting schedules";
    requests: "Leave request status";
    announcements: "Department updates";
    resources: "New teaching materials";
  };
}
```

### Student Notifications

  };

  courseRelated: {
    materials: "New study materials";
    announcements: "Course announcements";
    schedule: "Class schedule changes";
    grades: "New grades posted";
  };
}
```

### Parent Notifications
```typescript
interface ParentNotifications {
  academic: {
    attendance: "Daily attendance status";
    results: "Exam result updates";
    performance: "Academic progress alerts";
    behavior: "Conduct notifications";
  };

  administrative: {
    fees: "Payment reminders";
    meetings: "Parent-teacher meetings";
    events: "School event invitations";
    reports: "Progress report available";
  };
}
```

## 5. Real-Time Implementation
```typescript
interface NotificationSystem {
  delivery: {
    realTime: {
      websocket: "Instant push notifications";
      badge: "Unread count updates";
      sound: "Notification sound (toggle)";
      desktop: "Browser notifications (optional)";
    };
  };

  storage: {
    redis: {
      unreadCount: "notifications:unread:{userId}";
      recentItems: "notifications:recent:{userId}";
      expiry: "30 days";
    };
  };

  features: {
    markAsRead: "Single/Bulk read status update";
    clearAll: "Clear all notifications";
    muteTypes: "Mute specific notification types";
    preferences: "Notification settings page";
  };
}
```

## 6. Performance Optimization
```typescript
interface NotificationOptimization {
  caching: {
    strategy: "Cache first, update in background";
    polling: "Real-time for active users only";
    batching: "Group notifications when possible";
  };

  delivery: {
    prioritization: "Urgent first delivery";
    debouncing: "Prevent notification spam";
    queueing: "Handle high-volume periods";
  };
}
```

## 7. UI/UX Guidelines
