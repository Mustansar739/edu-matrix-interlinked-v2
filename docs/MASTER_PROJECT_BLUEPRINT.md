### 2.2 Architecture Patterns

#### Multi-Tenant Architecture

```typescript
interface TenantArchitecture {
  isolation: {
    data: "Schema per tenant";
    cache: "Prefixed Redis keys";
    events: "Partitioned Kafka topics";
  };
  scaling: {
    initial: "Single VPS";
    growth: "Multi-region ready";
    database: "Horizontal sharding ready";
  };
}
```

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Super Admin: Platform-wide access
- Institution Admin: Institution-specific access
- Teacher: Course and student management
- Student: Learning and interaction
- Parent: Monitoring and updates

#### Multi-Layer Caching

```typescript
interface CachingStrategy {
  layers: {
    browser: "Service Worker";
    edge: "Vercel Edge Cache";
    application: "Redis Cache";
    database: "PostgreSQL Query Cache";
  };
  invalidation: {
    strategy: "Event-driven";
    scope: "Tenant-specific";
    patterns: "Cache-aside + Write-through";
  };
}
```

#### Real-Time Event Processing

```
Event Source → Kafka → Event Processor → Notification Delivery → Multiple Channels
```

### 2.3 Database Design

#### Multi-Tenant Database Strategy

- Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- Tenant ID as sharding key
- Read replicas for performance
- Connection pooling for efficiency

#### Key Database Models

- Users & Authentication
- Institutions & Tenancy
- Courses & Enrollment
- Social Interactions
- Career Services
- Notifications & Events

### 2.4 API Structure

#### API Gateway Architecture

```typescript
interface APIGateway {
  routing: {
    external: {
      proxy: "Request forwarding";
      transform: "Response transformation";
      caching: "Response caching";
    };
    internal: {
      discovery: "Service discovery";
      loadBalance: "Request distribution";
      failover: "High availability";
    };
  };
  middleware: {
    security: {
      authentication: "Token validation";
      authorization: "Permission check";
      rateLimit: "Request throttling";
    };
    monitoring: {
      metrics: "Request tracking";
      logging: "Access logging";
      tracing: "Request tracing";
    };
  };
}
```

## 8. DUAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS & MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 8.1 Dual Authentication System Overview

EDU Matrix Interlinked implements a two-tier authentication system that handles both general platform access and institution-specific access:

#### SimpleAuth - General Platform Access

```typescript
interface SimpleAuth {
  purpose: "General platform access for all users";
  features: {
    registration: "Basic email registration";
    login: "Email/password login";
    session: "JWT-based sessions";
    security: "CSRF protection, rate limiting";
  };
  access: [
    "Social feed (Students Interlinked)",
    "Browse institutions (Edu Matrix Hub)",
    "Explore courses",
    "Freelancing marketplace",
    "Job listings",
    "Educational news",
    "Community room"
  ];
}
```

#### MatrixAuth - Institution-Based Access

```typescript
interface MatrixAuth {
  purpose: "Secure multi-tenant institution access with RBAC";
  features: {
    multiTenant: "Institution-specific isolation via institution_id";
    mfa: "Multi-factor authentication for sensitive roles";
    rbac: "Comprehensive role-based access control";
    parentLink: "Parent-student account relationships";
  };
  roleHierarchy: [
    "Supreme Admin (platform-wide)",
    "Institution Admin (institution-specific)",
    "Department Head (department-specific)",
    "Teacher (classroom level)",
    "Student (learning access)",
    "Parent (child monitoring)"
  ];
}
```

### 8.2 Authentication Flow & Transition

1. **Initial Access Flow**:

   - User registers via SimpleAuth (general platform auth)
   - Accesses public features (social feed, browse institutions, etc.)
   - Can apply to institutions or create a new institution

2. **Edu Matrix Hub Access Flow**:

   - User applies to join an institution in a specific role
   - Institution admin/department head reviews application
   - Upon approval, user gains institution-specific access
   - MatrixAuth creates role-based credentials within institution context

3. **New Institution Creation Flow**:

   - Existing platform user applies to create new institution
   - Supreme Admin reviews application
   - Upon approval, user automatically becomes Institution Admin
   - New institution_id generated with isolated environment

4. **Role Transition Flow**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       User->>Platform: Register (SimpleAuth)
       Platform->>User: Grant public access
       User->>MatrixCollege: Apply for role/institution
       MatrixCollege->>Admin: Forward application
       Admin->>MatrixCollege: Review & approve
       MatrixCollege->>User: Assign role & dashboard
   ```

### 8.3 Microservices Architecture with Initial Single VPS Hosting

EDU Matrix implements a pure microservices architecture even during the initial phase using a cost-effective single VPS deployment:

#### Initial VPS Strategy (First Year)

```typescript
interface InitialVPSSetup {
  hardware: {
    cpu: "2 vCPU cores";
    ram: "8GB";
    ssd: "100GB NVMe";
    bandwidth: "8TB";
  };
  optimization: {
    dockerContainers: "Service isolation";
    resourceLimits: "Per-service constraints";
    swapMemory: "4GB with swappiness=10";
    serviceOptimization: "Database, Redis, Kafka tuning";
  };
  scalability: {
    preparation: "Zero code changes needed for scale-out";
    architecture: "Pure microservices from day one";
    dataModel: "Microservice-specific schemas";
  };
  services: ["Next.js App", "PostgreSQL DB", "Redis Cache", "Kafka Messaging"];
}
```

#### Database Strategy for Microservices

```typescript
interface MicroservicesDatabase {
  initialPhase: {
    type: "Single PostgreSQL instance";
    isolation: "Schema per service";
    scaling: "Vertical initially, horizontal ready";
  };
  schemaIsolation: {
    naming: "service_name_schema";
    permissions: "Service-specific database users";
    migrations: "Independent per service";
  };
  schemas: [
    "students_platform_schema",
    "matrix_college_schema",
    "courses_platform_schema",
    "freelancing_schema",
    "jobs_portal_schema",
    "news_system_schema",
    "community_rooms_schema",
    "statistics_schema",
    "feedback_schema"
  ];
}
```

#### Zero-Downtime Migration Path

Once traffic increases beyond what the single VPS can handle, the architecture allows zero-downtime migration to a full Kubernetes cluster:

```
Initial Phase: Single VPS → Service Separation → Database Separation → Full Kubernetes
```

### 8.4 Edu Matrix Hub Multi-Tenant Implementation

The Edu Matrix Hub system represents the core multi-tenant architecture:

#### Institution Isolation

```typescript
interface InstitutionIsolation {
  database: {
    tables: "institution_id in all tables";
    queries: "Automatic tenant filtering";
    permissions: "Row-level security (RLS)";
  };
  authentication: {
    context: "Institution_id bound to session";
    validation: "Cross-tenant access prevention";
    permissions: "Role-specific capabilities";
  };
  api: {
    middleware: "Tenant validation on all requests";
    context: "Automatic tenant injection";
    responses: "Tenant-scoped data";
  };
}
```

#### Application & Role Assignment Process

1. **Institution Registration**:

   - User applies for new institution creation
   - Provides institution name, type, documentation
   - Supreme Admin reviews and approves
   - System generates unique institution_id
   - Original applicant automatically becomes Institution Admin

2. **Member Application Process**:

   - Existing platform users can apply to institutions
   - Application has role-specific requirements:
     - Teacher: Qualifications, experience, documents
     - Student: Academic records, identity verification
     - Department Head: Leadership experience, departmental vision
     - Parent: Link to student with approval workflow

3. **Role-Based Approval**:
   - Institution Admin approves institution-wide roles
   - Department Head approves department-specific roles
   - Upon approval, system automatically:
     - Assigns appropriate role in MatrixAuth
     - Creates institution-specific dashboard access
     - Sets up role-specific permissions
     - Enforces data isolation based on role scope

### 8.5 Implementation Guidelines for AI-Assisted Development

When implementing this architecture using AI tools like GitHub Copilot:

1. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Start with SimpleAuth for basic platform access
