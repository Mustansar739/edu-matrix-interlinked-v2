# Copilot Instructions — Edu Matrix Interlinked

## 🚀 Project Overview

A production-first, real-time educational social platform connecting students, educators, and institutions. Full-stack, strictly typed, enterprise-grade.

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

* ✅ **Production-ready only** — no placeholders, no todos, Everything must be complete and functional and ready for production
* 🏗️ **Full-stack** — End-to-end, from UI to backend,
* 🔁 **Real-time first** — Socket.IO + Kafka + Redis everywhere
* 🧱 **Typed & safe** — Full TypeScript, strict types, full error handling
* 📱 **Responsive** — Mobile-first, accessible, and performant
* 🔄 **Optimistic UI** — Instant UI updates with resilient syncing

---

## 🔧 Architecture Checklist

### Real-Time

* Socket.IO (messaging, presence, typing)
* Kafka (events, notifications)
* Redis (sessions, caching, queues)
* Offline queues & retry logic

### Messaging

* Instant delivery, receipts, reactions, threads, file uploads

### Notifications

* Real-time + push, read state, categories, history

---

## ⚡ Performance

* Transitions < 500ms
* Lazy load heavy components
* Static assets cached
* Redis + browser caching
* Code-split routes

---

## ✅ Testing Standards

### Tools

* **Playwright** (E2E via MCP)
* **React Testing Library**

### Coverage

* Real-time messaging
* Mobile flow
* Navigation & auth
* UI consistency (Visual Regression)
* Network/API validations

---

## 📜 Copilot Prompts Must Generate:

1. Complete, typed, real-time code
2. Fully error-handled logic
3. Optimistic & responsive UI
4. Accessible components
5. Performance-optimized flows
6. Relevant tests
7. **Never use `TODO` or stubs**

---

## 🧪 MCP Server with Playwright

* Automate browsers via MCP Playwright
* Full E2E with real browsers
* Screenshot diffs (UI regressions)
* API/network inspection
