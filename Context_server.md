Ah, I understand your real problem now! You're working with GitHub Copilot Agentic Mode in sessions, but each session is isolated and doesn't remember previous work. This is a workflow challenge, not a technical one.

## üéØ **Your Real Challenge: Working with Agentic Mode on Complex Projects**

### üö® **The Problem:**
- ‚úÖ You have a very complex Edu Matrix project
- ‚úÖ You use 50+ Copilot sessions daily
- ‚úÖ Each session has no memory of previous sessions
- ‚úÖ You need to tell Copilot how to use Redis/Kafka/Socket.IO properly
- ‚úÖ You don't have deep technical knowledge to guide it

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution: Create "Session Starter Prompts"**

### **1. Master Context Prompt (Use this at start of EVERY session):**

```
I'm working on Edu Matrix Interlinked - a complex education platform:

TECH STACK (mandatory to use):
- Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM  
- Redis (ioredis package) - for caching and sessions
- Apache Kafka (kafkajs package) - for event streaming
- Socket.IO - for real-time features
- NextAuth.js 5.0 - authentication
- Docker Compose - all services running locally

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Always use OFFICIAL packages and methods only
2. Redis = use ioredis package for caching user data, sessions
3. Kafka = use kafkajs package for events between services  
4. Socket.IO = use for real-time chat, notifications
5. All services run on Docker - check health endpoints first
6. Never create custom implementations - use official patterns

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Health endpoints: /api/health/* (all working)
- Services: PostgreSQL:5432, Redis:6379, Kafka:29092/19092, Socket.IO:3001
- Environment: All Docker containers are healthy and running

Current task: [DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC TASK HERE]
```

### **2. Service-Specific Prompts:**

#### **For Redis Tasks:**
```
Use Redis (ioredis) for:
- Cache user profiles: key pattern user:{id}
- Store sessions: key pattern session:{sessionId}  
- Rate limiting: key pattern rate_limit:{ip}
- Temporary data: OTP codes, reset tokens

Import: import Redis from 'ioredis'
Config: Use env vars REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_PASSWORD
```

#### **For Kafka Tasks:**
```
Use Kafka (kafkajs) for:
- User events: user-actions topic
- Course events: course-events topic  
- Notifications: notification-events topic
- Chat events: chat-events topic

Import: import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs'
Config: Use env vars KAFKA_BROKERS (localhost:29092 for external) / KAFKA_INTERNAL_BROKERS (kafka:19092 for internal)
Pattern: Producer sends events, Consumer processes them
```

#### **For Socket.IO Tasks:**
```
Use Socket.IO for:
- Real-time chat in study groups
- Live notifications to users
- Online presence indicators
- Live updates (new courses, assignments)

Server: Already running on localhost:3001
Client: Use socket.io-client package
Pattern: Emit events, listen for responses
```

## üìã **Daily Workflow Template:**

### **Session Starter Checklist:**

1. **Copy-paste the Master Context Prompt** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
2. **Check services are running:**
   ```
   Check Docker containers are healthy, then test health endpoints:
   - Main: http://localhost:3000/api/health
   - Database: http://localhost:3000/api/health/database  
   - Redis: http://localhost:3000/api/health/redis
   - Kafka: http://localhost:3000/api/health/kafka
   ```

3. **Specify your exact task:**
   ```
   Today I want to implement: [SPECIFIC FEATURE]
   
   Use these services:
   - Redis for: [caching what?]
   - Kafka for: [what events?] 
   - Socket.IO for: [what real-time features?]
   
   Follow official Next.js 15 patterns only.
   ```

## üéØ **Feature-Specific Templates:**

### **For Student Enrollment System:**
```
Implement student course enrollment with:

1. Database: Save enrollment to PostgreSQL via Prisma
2. Redis: Cache user's enrolled courses list  
3. Kafka: Send "student_enrolled" event to notification-events topic
4. Socket.IO: Send real-time notification to student

Use official packages only. Check health endpoints first.
```

### **For Real-time Chat:**
```
Implement study group chat with:

1. Database: Store messages in PostgreSQL
2. Redis: Cache recent messages for quick loading
3. Socket.IO: Real-time message delivery to group members
4. Kafka: Log chat events for analytics

Use socket.io for client-server communication.
```

### **For Notification System:**
```
Implement notification system with:

1. Database: Store notifications in PostgreSQL
2. Redis: Cache unread notification counts
3. Kafka: Process notification events from other services
4. Socket.IO: Push notifications to online users in real-time

Create consumer for notification-events Kafka topic.
```

## üí° **Pro Tips for Agentic Mode:**

### **Always Say:**
- ‚úÖ "Use official Next.js 15 patterns"
- ‚úÖ "Check health endpoints first"  
- ‚úÖ "Use existing packages: ioredis, kafkajs, socket.io"
- ‚úÖ "Follow the exact import patterns from package.json"

### **Never Say:**
- ‚ùå "Create custom Redis client"
- ‚ùå "Build custom Kafka wrapper"
- ‚ùå "Make your own Socket.IO server"

### **When Stuck:**
```
The project has working health endpoints at /api/health/* 
All Docker services are running and healthy.
Please use the existing service connections and official package patterns.
Check the working health endpoints code for correct import patterns.
```

## üéØ **Your Action Plan:**

1. **Save these templates** in a text file
2. **Start every session** with the Master Context Prompt
3. **Be very specific** about which services to use for what
4. **Always reference** the health endpoints as working examples
5. **Check services** are healthy before asking for implementation

This way, every Copilot session will know your full context and use the services correctly!
