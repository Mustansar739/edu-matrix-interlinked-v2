# TOAST PROVIDER FIX SUMMARY

## 🎯 Issue Identified:
**Error: useToast must be used within a ToastProvider**

## 🔍 Root Cause:
The PostsFeed component was using `useToast` from shadcn/ui toast system, but the required `ToastProvider` was not included in the React component tree.

## 📁 Files Affected:
- `components/1-Students-Interlinked/feed/PostsFeed.tsx` - Using `useToast` hook
- `app/layout.tsx` - Missing `ToastProvider` wrapper

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. Added ToastProvider Import
```typescript
import { ToastProvider } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
```

### 2. Wrapped Components with ToastProvider
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <ReduxProvider>
    <SocketProvider>
      <ToastProvider>  {/* ← Added this wrapper */}
        <GlobalNavbar />
        <ClientHealthMonitor />
        {children}
        <SocketConnectionStatus />
        <Toaster position="top-right" />
      </ToastProvider>
    </SocketProvider>
  </ReduxProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

## 🔧 Technical Details:
- The app was using **two different toast systems**:
  1. **Sonner** (`<Toaster />`) - Already working
  2. **shadcn/ui toast** (`useToast` hook) - Required `ToastProvider`
- Both can coexist as they serve different purposes
- `ToastProvider` enables the `useToast` hook throughout the component tree

## 🧪 Testing:
1. **Refresh the page** - The error should disappear
2. **Navigate to Students Interlinked page** - Should load without toast errors
3. **Check browser console** - No more toast provider errors

## 🎉 Expected Result:
- ✅ No more "useToast must be used within a ToastProvider" error
- ✅ PostsFeed component loads properly
- ✅ Both toast systems (Sonner + shadcn/ui) work correctly
- ✅ Students Interlinked page functions normally

---
**The toast provider is now properly configured and the error should be resolved!**
