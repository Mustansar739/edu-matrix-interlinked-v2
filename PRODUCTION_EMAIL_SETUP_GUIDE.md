# üìß Production Email Service Setup Guide

## üö® Current Issue Analysis

The error you're seeing:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (mmustansar739@gmail.com). 
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains
```

This indicates that your Resend API key is in **TEST MODE**, which restricts email sending to only the account owner's verified email address.

## üéØ **SOLUTION OPTIONS** (Choose One)

### Option 1: Upgrade Resend Account (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Verify a Custom Domain** OR **Use Resend's Default Domain**
3. **Get Production API Key** (not test key)

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Login to resend.com
# 2. Navigate to "Domains" section
# 3. Either:
#    - Add your own domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)
#    - Use resend.dev (already configured)
# 4. Get a PRODUCTION API key (not sandbox/test)
# 5. Update .env.local with the new key
```

### Option 2: Configure Development Bypass (Temporary)

Add this to your `.env.local` for development testing:

```bash
# Temporary bypass for development
RESEND_SKIP_VALIDATION=true
EMAIL_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
# This will log OTPs to console instead of sending emails
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Email Provider

Replace Resend with another provider:

#### A. **Gmail SMTP** (Free, Easy Setup)
```bash
# Add to .env.local
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password  # Generate in Gmail Security settings
```

#### B. **SendGrid** (Free Tier Available)
```bash
# Add to .env.local
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIX** (Choose Implementation)

### Quick Fix 1: Development Console Logging

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Log OTPs to console in development
EMAIL_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
RESEND_SKIP_VALIDATION=true
```

### Quick Fix 2: Use Your Verified Email

Test with the verified email address:
```bash
# Test registration with
Email: mmustansar739@gmail.com
# This will work with current setup
```

## üè≠ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### ‚úÖ **Resend Production Setup**
- [ ] Account upgraded to paid plan (if needed)
- [ ] Domain verified in Resend dashboard
- [ ] Production API key generated (not test key)
- [ ] DNS records configured (if using custom domain)
- [ ] SPF/DKIM records set up

### ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Production-ready configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_production_key
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_FROM_NAME="Edu Matrix Interlinked"
EMAIL_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false
```

### ‚úÖ **Alternative Provider Setup**
If using Gmail SMTP:

EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_SECURE=true
```

## üöÄ **Next.js App Status**

‚úÖ **Your Next.js 15 application IS production-ready!**
- Build successful ‚úÖ
- All routes working ‚úÖ  
- TypeScript validation passed ‚úÖ
- Production optimization complete ‚úÖ

‚ùå **Only the email service needs configuration**
- This is a service provider limitation, not an app issue
- Email sending is restricted by Resend's test mode
- Easy to fix with proper API key or alternative provider

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

1. **Check Current API Key Type**:
   ```bash
   # Look for this in your Resend dashboard
   # Test keys: Limited to verified email addresses
   # Production keys: Can send to any email address
   ```

2. **Verify Domain Status**:
   ```bash
   # Check if onboarding@resend.dev is still valid
   # Or if you need your own domain
   ```

3. **Test Email Sending**:
   ```bash
   # Try with mmustansar739@gmail.com (should work)
   # Then test with other addresses after upgrading
   ```
