## âœ… REAL-TIME EVENT FLOW

### Post Creation Flow
1. User creates post â†’ API endpoint
2. Post saved to database â†’ StudentsInterlinkedService.onPostCreated()
3. Event cached in Redis â†’ Kafka event published
4. Socket.IO emits 'students-interlinked:new-post' â†’ Frontend receives event
5. React Query cache updated â†’ UI updates instantly

### Comment Creation Flow  
1. User adds comment â†’ API endpoint
2. Comment saved to database â†’ StudentsInterlinkedService.onCommentCreated()
3. Event cached in Redis â†’ Notification sent to post author
4. Socket.IO emits 'students-interlinked:new-comment' â†’ Frontend receives event
5. UI updates instantly with new comment

### Story Interaction Flow
1. User views/reacts to story â†’ API endpoint
2. Interaction saved to database â†’ StudentsInterlinkedService.onStoryViewed/Liked()
3. Real-time notification to story author â†’ Frontend receives updates
4. Story stats update instantly in UI

### Notification Flow
1. Action triggers notification â†’ StudentsInterlinkedService.onNotificationCreated()
2. Notification cached and delivered â†’ Socket.IO emits 'students-interlinked:notification'
3. Frontend receives instant notification â†’ Toast appears + counter updates
