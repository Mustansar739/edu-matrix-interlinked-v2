You are building a full-stack web application with a focus on real-time features, performance, and responsiveness. The project uses modern technologies and frameworks to ensure a robust and scalable solution.
important requirements for alwasys with deep and dive reasoning: ( 
    Note: 
    1. each times when you do anything just tell me.
    2. what you are doing and.
    3. why you are doing this and.
    4. what is the purpose of this code and how it is working and.
    5. how it is making the project production ready and real-time with socketio and kafka and redis. 
    6. and how it is making the project responsive for all devices and browsers.
    7. always rememeber what is your goal and how you are achieving this goal.
    9. don't use any manual methods or fuctions or files or stretgy, use only real and authontic methods and functions and files and strategy.
    10. properly use socketio and kafka and redis and event streaming and cahcing and notifications (proper use produers and consummers of kafka).
    11. always use pnpm package manager.)

Requrements with deep and dive reasoning with complete data flow : 
Note: This is a full-stack project " pnpm is a package manager ".
1. requirements: To make everything production ready and real-time.
2. requirements: To properly use Socket.IO for real-time messaging and notifications, Apache Kafka for event streaming, and Redis for caching and session management for fast performance etc.
3. requirements: To ensure that the project is responsive for all devices and browsers, including desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile.
4. requirements: use universal follow and universal like buttons for all components with proper functionality.
5. requirements: To ensure that the project is fully functional and does not contain any TODOs or development mode features. Make everything production ready and realtime.
6. requirements: use mcp server playwright for browser automations .
7. requirements: pnpm package manager.
8. requirements: verify that socketio and kafka and redis and event streaming and cahcing and notifications are properly (implemented or not ? ) in in app.
9. requirements: Real-time ui updates with proper events handling.
10. requirements: properly handle kafka producer and consumer events and make sure that everything is working properly.
11. requirements: add proper error handling and logging for all events and operations.
11. requirements: add proper comments.
## 🔐 Core Principles

* ✅ **Production-ready only** — no placeholders, no todos, Everything must be complete and functional and ready for production
* 🏗️ **Full-stack** — End-to-end, from UI to backend to realtime events and cache and realtime,
* 🔁 **Real-time first** — Socket.IO + Kafka + Redis everywhere
* 🧱 **Typed & safe** — Full TypeScript, strict types, full error handling
* 📱 **Responsive** — Mobile-first, accessible, and performant
* 🔄 **Optimistic UI** — Instant UI updates with resilient syncing

## ⚡ Performance

* Transitions < 500ms
* Lazy load heavy components
* Static assets cached
* Redis + browser caching
* Code-split routes


# Real-time Communication and Notifications
Make each and everything real-time not more todos or dev mode word finally make everything production ready and real-time. Use Socket.IO for real-time messaging and notifications, Apache Kafka for event streaming, and Redis for caching and session management.
do hard word and No more dev mode or todos, and  everything should be production ready and real-time.
