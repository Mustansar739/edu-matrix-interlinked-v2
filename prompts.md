# üö® ERROR DEBUGGING & FIXING PROMPT

NOTE: Recommendations for GitHub Copilot >
"Tell me each step you are doing and why"
GitHub Copilot recommendations for actual hard work‚Äîfollow these steps:

1. Add proper comments in each file to explain its purpose and usage;
2. Analyze each file line by line to understand its functionality;
3. Do not assume anything; do not make excuses; do actual hard work.
4. Don't be lazy‚Äîdo real, thorough work.
5. Follow official patterns, methods, and file structures of Next.js 15+; use their official documentation for each step and feature. Review the code before and after changes.
6. Use a systematic approach to identify all issues, errors, and inconsistencies in frontend, backend, and data flow.
7. Use a methodical approach: break down each problem into clearly numbered steps.
8. Make everything production-ready; do not add any TODOs. Provide systematic fixes rather than just addressing symptoms.












 github copilot actual recomendations to follow these steps : 
 1.  Do not assume anything because this project is very complex  understood ; 
 2.  do not make excuses; 
 3. don't be lazy please do hard work; 
 4. do actual work i mean real work .
 5. follow official documentations for each step and feature
"actual requirements instead of assumed"



# üö® ERROR DEBUGGING & FIXING PROMPT

0. tell me each step
1. Find root cause
2. Fix the actual problem
3. Verify it's flow frontend and backend and database and api and all related files     
4. to identify all issues, errors, and inconsistencies.
5. give me complete status






 and pelase pik files one by one and read line by line and analyze them and fix them because overall files are correct but their internaly forms data submissions and show in profiles and input fields are not correctly working first you analyze this prompt and then proceed
